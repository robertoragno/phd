    "text": "This research seeks to explore the dynamics of human-nature interaction in Italy during the first millennium CE. How did the agrarian practices differ in the Roman period between smaller and larger farms? When did the first moment of discontinuity in these practices occur? Were the Roman economic structures and farming practices completely abandoned or did they find continuity during the turbulent transition to the early medieval period? Which agricultural strategies did peasants develop to cope with political, demographic and climatic change?\nDespite the increasing study of plant and animal remains from archaeological excavations, a comprehensive synthesis of data on the Italian landscape during the 1st millennium CE does not yet exist. Much of the existing synthetic work focuses on specific, smaller areas or distinct chronologies within the peninsula, limiting the potential for broader comparative analysis across different regions. This study addresses this gap by providing the first available reconstruction of the Italian farming landscape of the 1st millennium CE, based on legacy carpological and zooarchaeological data. By integrating various types of information, it becomes possible to reconstruct the complex interactions between humans and nature during this period.\nThis study focuses on 190 archaeobotanical assemblages and 466 zooarchaeological assemblages from a total of 309 sites, providing information for the period between the 1st century BCE and the 11th century CE. The selected temporal boundaries are framed by significant historical events: the late 1st century BCE marks the onset of the Roman imperial phase, while the 11th century aligns with the phenomenon of incastellamento (the creation of castles and reorganisation of rural territories) and the medieval agricultural revival (described in Toubert, 1973). This re-evaluation of plant and faunal remains datasets has led to a fresh assessment of transitional crop and animal husbandry practices, shedding light on the agricultural dynamics of a critical period in Italian history.\nThe approach used in this assessment is statistical modelling, specifically within a Bayesian framework, of plant and animal remains. Seeds, caryopses and bones are useful proxies for agricultural reconstructions that can be modelled to examine our historical assumptions. In particular, Bayesian multilevel modelling has been used to account for overdispersion and class imbalance in the datasets, providing estimates in the form of probabilities. When analysing datasets with assemblages that are subject to sampling bias, a rigorous approach to data analysis is required to avoid overly confident interpretations. In this respect, a major advantage of Bayesian modelling is its explicit ability to incorporate uncertainty into the estimation process. This approach is more intuitive than a frequentist perspective in the sense that estimates are accompanied by credible intervals that provide a range of values within which the true parameter value lies. This research seeks to identify the most common domesticated plants/animals and wild resources during the first millennium and to estimate their probability of occurrence. The aim is to evaluate the role of these resources in Italian sites, in order to assess possible explanations for peasant agricultural choices in terms of diet and economy.\nChapter 2 provides an overview of the main debates surrounding (i) the agrarian economy during the first millennium CE, (ii) previous research on Italian bioarchaeology, diet, and climate reconstructions, and (iii) statistical research in archaeology. Chapters 3 and 4 present the materials used for the statistical analyses, as well as sampling and preservation issues. Chapter 5 describes the structure of the database created to store the raw data. Chapter 6 outlines the methodology used in this study, while Chapters 7 and 8 present the research findings. Chapter 9 discusses the results and presents hypothetical scenarios for the reconstruction of the historical Italian landscape. The conclusions of this thesis are presented in Chapter 10.\n\n\n\n\nToubert, P., 1973. Les structures du Latium médiéval: le Latium méridional et la Sabine du IXe à la fin du XIIe siècle.

    "section": "2.1 The Agricultural Economy",
    "text": "2.1 The Agricultural Economy\nThis research places significant emphasis on the role of agricultural economy. In pre-modern societies, agriculture held a central position as it not only provided sustenance but also served as a primary source of taxation. The transition from early forms of hunter-gatherer economies to more controlled and centralised systems has been a subject of extensive debate among scholars. One compelling perspective on this transition is presented by James Scott (2017), who introduced the concept of “grain states”. These were systems that relied on regular harvests and the ability to store and tax grain, which served as a predictable and taxable form of income. Grains, in particular free-threshing wheat and barley, exemplify these characteristics. They can be sown in the winter (although not necessarily) and harvested in early summer, requiring comparatively less intensive field management during their growth period. On the other hand, legumes and fruits demand more intensive care, and the storage of fruits, for instance, poses challenges and is not suitable for long-distance transportation. Ancient Rome is an example of such “grain state”, as the empire heavily relied on cereals both for taxation purposes and to sustain its own population, especially during its peak demographic period. The ability to predictably tax and manage the production of grains played a crucial role in sustaining the empire’s vast territory, and agriculture, being the main sector of the economy at this time (Heinrich, 2017; Marcone, 2019, 2004; Vera, 1996), held significant importance. The imperial period has been extensively studied and debated in relation to ancient Roman agricultural economy. In the following section, various economic models of the Roman agricultural system will be introduced. Traditionally, much of the focus has been on villa productions, with less attention given to smallholders. More recently, there has been a growing interest in Roman peasants, and archaeological research has played a crucial role in providing insight into their lives, which are often overshadowed by documentary sources. Identifying Roman peasantry through archaeology is nevertheless not a straightforward task, as the traces are often less conspicuous compared to the monumental structures associated with elites or the well-preserved artefacts found in urban contexts. In particular, this research will explore the use of archaeobotanical and zooarchaeological data to attempt to trace farmers’ strategies and agricultural practices. While the factors influencing crop selection have been more explicitly discussed for the Republican and early imperial periods (i.e. market demand, climatic adaptability, introduction of ley farming, etc.), the same level of insight is not as readily available for other periods within the scope of this research, particularly in Italy. However, there has been significant discussion among historians regarding changes in agricultural practices during the early medieval period, which will be examined. Overall, past archaeological literature has contributed to our understanding of rural dynamics, but the integration with different types of archaeological sources can improve this picture.\n\n2.1.1 The Roman imperial phase\nWhen examining agriculture in the late Roman Republic and Empire, there is a prevalent image of a dominus overseeing a vast estate, known as a villa, with enslaved individuals working in the fields (Carandini, 1988). This image, influenced by classical texts such as Cato’s De agri cultura and Columella’s De re rustica, has led to the association of Roman agriculture with a quasi-capitalist framework. While scholars like Max Weber (2008[1891]) have acknowledged capitalist elements in the Roman economy, such as its inclination towards a market system, they have not fully recognized capitalism in Roman agriculture (Lo Cascio, 2009a; Love, 1986). The absence of a labour market and the prevalence of slavery pose challenges to the direct application of a capitalist framework in understanding Roman agricultural practices. Moses Finley (1973) adopted a “primitivist” approach, aligning with some of Weber’s perspectives. Finley argued that Roman agriculture primarily operated under a pre-capitalist mode of production. According to Finley, the Roman agricultural system relied heavily on personal relationships, social status, patronage, and traditional forms of labour organization, rather than conforming to capitalist market dynamics. He contended that the Roman elite lacked the entrepreneurial mindset necessary for economic and technological growth (Haas and Tol, 2017, p. 16). This position was much criticised by the “modernists”, notably Peter Temin (2013, p. 114), who instead believed that ancient Rome had a labour market and questioned the notion that slavery indicated a non-market economy, especially considering the unique characteristics of ancient slavery in comparison to its modern counterpart. Temin (2013, p. 4) famously argued that “the economy of the early Roman Empire was primarily a market economy”. Modernist approaches conceptualise classical economy in a similar fashion to the modern one, with mechanisms of supply and demand. The existence of a market system is evident in the transportation of agricultural products across the peninsula and the broader Roman Empire. The movement of such goods indicates the presence of economic exchanges and trade networks. Furthermore, specific agricultural products became associated with particular regions or places, highlighting the localization of production. For instance, in the Roman suburbium, one could find pears from Signia, nuts from Praeneste, and pastio villatica (the production of luxury items such as small birds, honey, flowers for banquets, etc.) from Tarquinii , Figure 2.1.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Production in the Roman suburbium. Image after Morley (1996, p. 84).\n\n\nSeveral adjustments to both models have been proposed, with some scholars arguing that the primitivist/modernist dichotomy is too extreme (Schiavone, 1989, p. 20). Others argue that more recent economic frameworks need to be considered, in particular New Institutional Economics (NIE) and Complexity Economics (CE) (Van Limbergen et al., 2022, p. 2). The first, NIE, considers the role of institutions and organizations in driving the economic behaviour of societies. In this approach, economic growth is only obtained through a market system (Scheidel et al., 2007). The concepts of the NIE have also been adopted by historians of the ancient economy in Italy, who have recently recognised a greater role for the imperial institution both as an actor and as an economic legislator (Maiuro, 2014). However, the lack of agency in NIE has been criticised by Wilson and Flohr (2016, p. 4), who believe that institutions are just starting points for economic strategies. In turn, CE is more dynamic, allowing agents to create and adapt strategies according to specific situations: economic systems are in fact “complex adaptive systems” (Van Limbergen et al., 2022, p. 6; Verboven, 2021). In this sense, Elio Lo Cascio (2009b, pp. 273–276), while borrowing language from the NIE, acknowledges the special position of the Roman emperor as a market regulator when necessary. According to the historian, state control does not take the form of dirigisme, which limits the free market, but promotes its functioning. As noted by Kim Bowes (2021), alongside the on-going academic debate on which economic framework is best suited for analysing Roman economy, the study of the ancient economy experienced a significant shift in the 1990s with some historians embracing a cliometric turn (Maddison, 2003, 2001; Piketty and Goldhammer, 2014). Scholars increasingly employed quantitative methods and sought to quantify various aspects of the Roman economy, including the measurement of gross domestic product (GDP), economic performance, inequality, and other key indicators. Some of these methods are collected in the work “Quantifying the Roman Economy: Methods and Problems” (Bowman and Wilson, 2009). While the integration of quantitative approaches in ancient economics is on the rise, it is important to acknowledge that these methods are not without their limitations. In this respect, Bowes (2021, pp. 8–10) raises critical points regarding certain efforts in the field. Specifically, she directs her criticism towards works that draw comparisons between the ancient economy and other premodern economies, such as 17th century England or 10th century China, using methods that have received little scrutiny. Bowes argues that instead of relying solely on such comparisons, it is more valuable to focus on obtaining granular data at the household level. While Bowes’ critique highlights the need for caution and a more nuanced approach in employing quantitative methods, it does not diminish the overall trend of increasing integration of these approaches in the study of ancient economies. Recent publications exemplify this integration by showcasing the use of quantitative methods in studying the Roman economy. For instance, the volume “Complexity Economics: Building a New Approach to Ancient Economic History” (Verboven, 2021) features case studies that employ network analysis and computational modelling to understand the complexities of the Roman economy. Similarly, the book “Simulating Roman Economies: Theories, Methods, and Computational Models” (Brughmans and Wilson, 2022) delves into the application of computational models to simulate and analyse Roman economic systems. These examples demonstrate the growing integration of quantitative approaches in the study of ancient economies, allowing researchers to explore the empirical dimensions of the Roman economy while also engaging with theoretical discussions. Despite their increasing integration into the economic debate, it is indeed true, as Bowes (2021, p. 27) pointed out, that these new major textbooks often prioritize large-scale questions and run the risk of creating deterministic narratives that view the past through teleological lenses of “rise” and “fall.” This limitation is perhaps inherent in computational modelling, which tends to focus on hypothesis testing and requires substantial data to construct narratives and contextualize the information historically. The need to make the reasoning behind causal inference more explicit when constructing models will be addressed in Chapter 6.\nIf this chapter section began with an image depicting large estates worked by slaves in the Roman rural countryside (which we will revisit shortly), they were not the sole labour force involved. The post-war historical debate has placed increasing emphasis on the presence of other agents in the Roman rural landscape. In this context, the work of Karl Marx had for sure an impact in the popularity of bottom-up histories, as Eric Hobsbawm (1998, pp. 178–185) remarks. While slaves undoubtedly played a significant role especially in large-scale farming operations, agricultural activities encompassed a diverse range of individuals and groups. After all, traditional Roman texts consistently portray the image of a simple peasant working on a fundus to sustain his family. Free peasants involved in agricultural activities could take on different roles as either freeholders or tenants (coloni). Peter Garnsey, who extensively studied peasants in the Classical age, mentions tenancy as “the most common method of production in the empire taken as a whole” (Garnsey, 1998, p. 94). In fact, peasants were not limited to working on small-scale agricultural plots. They could also be involved in renting and cultivating both large and small estates. In his writings, the Roman agronomist Columella (Rust., 1.7.3–4) expresses criticism towards farmers who rent large parcels of land and neglect their responsibilities by leaving their servants in charge. He also disapproves of farmers who choose to reside in the town rather than overseeing their lands directly. Roman tenancy agreements, which are primarily known through the preserved Egyptian contracts, displayed a remarkable degree of diversity. These agreements encompassed various structures, ranging from short-term to long-term leases, and the methods of rent payment varied as well. If monetary payment was customary, sharecropping could be an alternative option for tenants. Sharecropping involved a fixed payment in kind, which provided tenants with some protection against market fluctuations. Sharecropping can be understood as an arrangement where tenants contribute a portion of their agricultural produce to the landlord instead of paying rent in cash. This practice mitigated the risks associated with market volatility, as the tenant and landlord shared the uncertainties of agricultural production together (Erdkamp, 2005, pp. 26–29). In a letter from 107 CE in Pliny the Younger’s Epistulae (Ep., IX, 37, 1-2), it is clear how sharecropping increased risk not only for the tenant but also for the landlord, but it also encouraged long-term profitability. The sharing of risks and rewards created a mutually beneficial relationship between the tenant and the landlord. Sharecropping was particularly well-suited for capital-intensive arable farming, as suggested by Pieter W. de Neeve (1990). This includes the cultivation of cash crops like olives and grapes, which necessitated substantial investments. In addition to slaves and tenants, there were other types of labourers in the Roman rural countryside, which are rarely discussed in ancient sources. These included wage-earners, known as mercenarii, and debt-bondsmen, known as obaerarii. Varro (Rust, I, 17, 2-3), in his De re rustica, is informative on this matter:\n\nAll agriculture is carried on by men — slaves, or freemen, or both; by freemen, when they till the ground themselves, as many poor people do with the help of their families; or hired hands (mercenarii), when the heavier farm operations, such as the vintage and the haying, are carried on by the hiring of freemen; and those whom our people called obaerarii and of whom there are still many in Asia, in Egypt, and in Illyricum. With regard to these in general this is my opinion: it is more profitable to work unwholesome lands with hired hands than with slaves; and even in wholesome places it is more profitable thus to carry out the heavier farm operations, such as storing the products of the vintage or harvest.\n\nAmong these workers, the role of wage labourers is of particular interest. According to scholars like Peter Garnsey (1998), the significance of slavery in rural production may have been overstated. Both Paul Erdkamp (2005, pp. 80–83) and Garnsey (1998, p. 108) suggest that wage labourers were primarily found on large estates, where they would supplement the work of slaves during peak agricultural periods such as grain harvest and vintage. Wage labourers might not have constituted a distinct social class. Instead, they could also have been individuals who owned or rented their own farms and engaged in wage labour to earn additional income (Garnsey, 1998, p. 145). K. D. White (1970) estimates that dedicating 100 out of the 250 working days available to cultivating the land is adequate for subsistence farming. As a result, subsistence farmers would have approximately three months of available time for engaging in paid work. If small-scale farmers were not primarily focused on surplus production, they had the potential to offer additional labour. However, it is the large estates or villas that emerge as the most significant surplus producers for the market. The villae rusticae, which are believed to have originated in Thyrrenian central Italy, specifically in regions such as Latium, northern Campania, and southern Tuscany (Etruria), are described in particular by Varro and Columella (Marzano, 2007). Villas were characterized by their dual composition—a residential section (pars urbana) and a productive centre (pars rustica). The residential section was reserved for the landowner, while the latter served as the productive core of the villa, where slaves were dedicated to cultivating cash crops. Among these, grapes and olives held particular significance, as wine and olive oil could be transported over long distances. By the mid-1st c. CE, it is estimated that there were seventy-one grape cultivars (varieties) and fifteen olive varieties in cultivation (Marzano, 2022, p. 276). These crops were not only labour-intensive, requiring a significant workforce especially during peak seasons, but also demanded substantial initial investments. To support the production of wine and olive oil, cellar rooms (cellae vinariae or oleariae) needed to be constructed to store the produce in buried containers known as dolia defossa. Further high costs resulted from other necessary facilities, including presses, floors, vats (palmenti) and additional related structures and equipment. Additionally, the harvest also needed to be protected from pests, such as caterpillars, mice, and foxes (Dodd, 2022; Hollander, 2019, pp. 27–28). To appreciate the significance of such expenditure, one must take into account that the profitability of these investments frequently took several years to manifest: grapevines and olive trees typically reached their full productive capacity only after a decade of cultivation. Extensive research has been conducted on villas, resulting in a vast bibliography on the subject. What we can assert is that villas began to appear in the 2nd-1st century BCE as large estates that specialised in cultivating specific cash crops, particularly olives and grapes for the production of olive oil and wine. The owners of these villas rarely engaged directly in agricultural work. Instead, they entrusted the daily management of the estate to a vilicus who oversaw the day-to-day affairs of the villa (Marcone, 2004). The subject of “slave villas” (villa schiavistica) has occupied much of the ongoing debate surrounding Roman agrarian history, and it continues to generate significant interest. Notably, the first scientific Italian excavation of a Roman site was the excavation of a villa in southern Tuscany known as Settefinestre. Andrea Carandini (1985), working within a Marxist framework (Giardina and Schiavone, 1981), portrayed the villa as a plantation reminiscent of American colonial style, highlighting the significant role of slavery in the operation of these estates. In particular, Carandini (1989, p. 177) claimed to have identified a complex of twenty-six cells as an ergastulum, a prison interpreted as a large breeding farm for slaves to be sent to Rome. In each of these cells there would have been a family of about one hundred people. The increased number of slaves following the Punic Wars (fought between 264 and 146 BCE) was a decisive factor in the expansion of villas, as it provided villa owners with a substantial labour force to work the lands. This was particularly significant considering the post-war decline in the population, which resulted in a decreased availability of citizens to engage in agricultural work due to their involvement in wars (Toynbee, 1965). Furthermore, the eastward expansion during the late Republic and early Empire had a notable impact on the availability of slaves for agricultural labour. Carandini (1981) suggested that these centuries marked a shift from Republican small-scale family-sized farms to profit-oriented large-estates. While it remains true that villas mainly employed a large amount of slaves in their production, a variety of free workers could have also been employed, especially when more workforce was required. When Roman expansionism slowed down in the 2nd c. CE, the resulting crisis in the availability of slaves pushed landowners towards other forms of management (Pinchetti, 2021, p. 10). In this period, the number of tenancy contracts increased significantly, with coloni leasing rural plots for short or long-term occupancy solutions, already discussed above.\nIn the previous paragraph, we discussed the development of villae rusticae and their exploitation of cash crops. Cash crops, particularly grapes and olives, were highly indicated for their market value and long-distance transportability. The selection of crops on any given farm was influenced by various factors, including economic considerations. Understanding why crop selection is important economically involves analysing choices such as selecting cereals over arboriculture or the specific type of cereal to cultivate. Multiple cereals can be chosen, or only one, each with different nutritional values, yields, and adaptability to different climates and geographies. Factors such as climate, soil quality, water availability, and geographic location must also be considered for the choice of cereal crops. Furthermore, crops have varying shelf lives, which affect their storage and marketability. When deciding which crops to cultivate, farmers take into account market demand, production costs, storage capabilities, and processing requirements. They assess the profitability of different crops based on factors like yield, market price, and input costs. For instance, farmers can choose high-income cash crops, like grapes and olives mentioned earlier, which require significant investments but offer potential long-term returns. On the other hand, cereals serve as staple food crops but may have lower market value and profit margins. Within the cereal category, farmers must consider specific grain types. Some crops, like free-threshing (or naked) wheats, are less durable and more susceptible to damage from bacteria, fungi, and other pests during storage. Conversely, hulled (or husked) wheats provide better protection but require additional processing, which adds to the production costs. Numerous crop selection models have been proposed for the Roman age, and a comprehensive overview is provided in Frits Heinrich (2017). One of the earliest scholars to discuss crop selection in the Roman era, albeit in different terms, was the economist Naum Jasny. Jasny’s (1944; 1942) research on competition among grains in classical antiquity compared different cereal taxa based on productivity, performance, geological adaptability, and economic factors. Notably, he argued for a transition from emmer wheat (Triticum dicoccum) to hard wheat (Triticum durum) during the Roman age, which was completed in Late Antiquity. According to Jasny, hard wheat provided better yields and was more suitable for bread baking. Emilio Sereni, an Italian agronomist, historian, and partisan, renowned for his work Storia del paesaggio agrario Italiano (1961), provided a model specifically for Italy. Sereni also observed the shift towards hard wheat, but his approach was less evolutionistic compared to Jasny. Sereni argued that hulled wheats were inferior to naked wheats, while Jasny believed that the choice between naked and hulled wheats depended on specific circumstances. In his work, Sereni emphasized the strong correlation between crop selection and economic factors—during periods of economic growth, specialisation occurred, whereas periods of depression led to greater crop diversity. In line with this perspective, Sereni argued that the number of cereal crops was higher in Republican Rome compared to the Imperial period, only to experience growth once again in Late Antiquity. This perspective contradicted Jasny’s evolutionary viewpoint. In the 1980s, another significant contribution to crop selection models is found in the works of M.S. Spurr (1986, 1983). Spurr responded to the perspectives put forth by Jasny and Sereni by arguing against the significance of climatic and geological factors in crop selection, emphasizing the overriding importance of economic considerations for peasants. According to Spurr’s model, specialisation would be the logical outcome of a thriving agricultural economy. However, this was not the case in Roman agriculture which was characterized by high diversification and by the use of ‘minor’ crops including millets. Robert Sallares (1991) also identified a transition from hulled to naked wheats in classical Greece, and argued that it was an unintentional process of crop improvement that originated in Neolithic times. Sallares challenged Jasny’s perspective by suggesting that factors beyond cereal suitability criteria, such as demographic pressure, played a more significant role in the crop selection process. Furthermore, recent research conducted by Daphne Lentjes (2013), focusing on several sites in southeast Italy occupied during the 1st millennium BCE, revealed that while naked wheats became slightly more prevalent, other cereal taxa remained present without notable disappearance. Heinrich’s (2017) perspective on crop selection in the Roman era takes a more cautious approach, emphasizing the importance of precise archaeobotanical quantifications that go beyond simple presence/absence analyses. Heinrich highlights that crop selection was highly situational and influenced by factors such as market accessibility and taxation exemptions, particularly in the case of Roman Italy. The absence of taxation for Italian farmers provided them with greater freedom in choosing which crops to cultivate.\nThe scope of agricultural decision-making was not only limited to plants, but included also animals. The historian Geoffrey Kron (2004), mostly basing on textual and zooarchaeological evidence, argued that convertible husbandry was a common practice in Roman times. Further hypotheses for this practice, based on archaeological evidence, can be found in The Roman Peasant Project (Bowes, 2020), a series of excavations conducted between 2009 and 2014 in southern Tuscany that specifically targeted peasant settlements. Convertible husbandry, also known as ley farming, involved a strategic allocation of arable land for both crop cultivation and pasture. Kron maintains that by implementing ley agriculture, peasants could optimize the productivity of their farms. The process of ley farming followed a productive regenerating cycle. Initially, certain plots of the farm are intensively cultivated with crops, such as cereals. Subsequently, these plots were sown with legumes, which served as nitrogen-fixing plants (Liu et al., 2011). Although ancient agronomists may not have fully understood the scientific basis behind this practice, they were aware of the positive effects of legumes on soil fertility, as Cato and Columella suggest (Hollander, 2019, p. 30). Support for the benefits of legumes can also be found in the works of Theophrastus (Hist. Pl., VIII, 9), a Greek botanist who noted in his Historia Plantarum (written around the fourth to third century BCE) that beans seemed to have a fertilizing effect:\n\nBeans, as was said, are in other ways not a burdensome crop to the ground, they even seem to manure it, because the plant is of loose growth and rots easily.\n\nFollowing the cultivation of legumes, the cultivated plots were set aside and utilised as pastures, known as leys, for a specific period of time. This rotational approach ensured that there was always a designated area available for livestock grazing. By allowing the land to rest and serve as pasture, farmers not only provided a source of food for their animals but also allowed for the regeneration of the soil. As with crops, farmers took a number of factors into account when selecting livestock, including economic considerations, resource availability and market demand. They assessed the potential profitability and suitability of different livestock species based on their ability to yield meat, dairy, and other secondary products (e.g. wool, fat, etc.). While climatic conditions had a relatively smaller impact on animal selection compared to crop selection, it is true that certain environments are more conducive to raising specific species. For example, pigs were a versatile choice that could be raised almost anywhere. However, raising them in forested areas was economically advantageous due to the availability of acorns and other nuts, which served as a natural and abundant food source for pigs (Hollander, 2019, p. 34). This utilisation of local resources optimized the efficiency of livestock production and minimized the need for external inputs. The selection of animals for specific purposes, such as draught animals for agricultural work or specialised breeds for secondary products like wool or milk, further exemplified the complexity of the selection process. In Roman times, cattle were the most common working animals, primarily utilised for traction in agricultural operations. Their main role was to provide the power necessary for plowing, pulling carts, and other tasks requiring heavy labour. However, cattle also served other purposes, including meat production, leather, and the utilisation of their bones for various crafts and tools. The cattle husbandry sector experienced growth and specialisation during this period, as evidenced by the significant increase in the average height of cattle during the Imperial age. Research by Jacopo De Grossi Mazzorin and Claudia Minniti (2022, pp. 70–71) provides insights into the changing characteristics of cattle in Rome. The study examined the average height at the withers, a key measurement in determining the size of quadrupeds. In the Republican phase, the average height was reported as 115.7 (N=9, SD=11.9), while during the Imperial phase, it increased to 129.4 (N=18, SD=6.2). This increase in height indicates a deliberate focus on breeding larger and stronger cattle, reflecting the demand for more efficient and powerful working animals. Certain regions of the peninsula specialised in cattle breeding. Areas such as Venosa, Sabina (north of Rome), southern Etruria, the Alps and pre-Alps were known for their specialised cattle husbandry practices (De Grossi Mazzorin and Minniti, 2022, p. 68). While larger estates had the means to sustain multiple working animals, small-scale peasants likely had to manage with just one. Alternatively, they might have resorted to renting or borrowing animals from neighbouring farmers on an as-needed basis. Farmers had to weigh the benefits and costs of different animal types to ensure optimal utilisation of resources and maximize their economic returns. The interaction between crop selection and animal farming was intricately connected, as the availability and suitability of certain crops influenced the choice of livestock and vice versa. For example, the cultivation of specific crops like fodder or forage crops played a crucial role in providing feed for livestock and, as argued above, the by-products of animal farming, such as manure, were valuable resources for crop cultivation, contributing to the overall agricultural productivity. In addition to these considerations, various factors influenced the choice of animals to raise, similar to the selection process for plants. For example, pig meat was highly valued and likely in high demand during periods of high population density. The Roman suburbium, with its proximity to the city of Rome, likely played a significant role in pig farming, as evidenced by numerous excavations reports. In particular, the predominance of certain skeletal parts reflects the consumption of certain cuts of meat and indicates that pork was the most common meat (De Grossi Mazzorin and Minniti, 2022).\n\n\n2.1.2 The late Roman Phase\nTracing the agrarian history of the late Roman period is a challenging task, primarily due to the limitations of ancient sources that predominantly inform us on the lives of the elite. The representation of the medium and small class of peasants in these sources is limited, hindering a comprehensive understanding of their experiences. Much of the available evidence often pertains to fiscal matters, prompting historians to concentrate on topics such as slavery, wage labour, tenancy contracts, and the fate of what used to be the core of Roman large-scale agricultural production: the rural villa. Several studies have focused on explaining the transformations that took place in villas during the period from the 3rd to the 5th century. Beth Munro (2012) identified three distinct phases in this phenomenon. The first phase, observed in the 3rd century, reveals an overall decline in the number of villas. In the subsequent phase, occurring in the 4th century, the surviving villas underwent a process of monumentalisation. This involved the enhancement and embellishment of existing structures, perhaps as a response to socio-political changes or the desire for ostentatious displays of wealth and status. The final phase, extending into the 5th and 6th centuries, saw a gradual abandonment of villas. This phase is characterised by a progressive disintegration of the once thriving villa culture, as various factors – which will be examined shortly – potentially contributed to the declining significance of villas during this period. Villas were abandoned at different rates. In particular, monumental villas – such as those on the coast in central Italy – lasted longer, while rural villas tended to be abandoned earlier (Marzano, 2007, p. 207). Patterns of abandonment and functional change also show regional variations, with southern villas (particularly in Apulia) surviving longer (up to the 6th/7th centuries) (Castrorao Barba, 2020, 2017, 2014a, 2014b).\nThe focus on villas in the study of late empire agrarian history is primarily attributed to their prominent role as cash crop producers during the late Republic and early imperial phase, as described in the previous section. The significant contribution of villas to agricultural production during this period has led many scholars to speculate that the decline in the number of villas was linked to a decline in overall agricultural output. Support for this hypothesis can be found in ceramic findings, which indicate an increase in the prevalence of foreign imports. While wine exports may have experienced a decline in the late 1st and early 2nd centuries, the production of wine, a commodity closely associated with rural villas, continued to be important in Italy, although during this period some of the larger central Italian villas appear to have invested more in monumentalisation than in viticulture (Dodd, 2022, p. 453). Moreover, there was a noticeable shift towards more localised wine production, as documented by Clementina Panella (1993, 1989) and André Tchernia (1986). The question of whether a crisis occurred during the late empire period is a subject of debate among scholars. Prominent archaeologists such as Carandini (1989, p. 130) argue for the occurrence of a crisis and destructuration during the Antonine age:\n\nThe end of the second century brought to an end for Italy the chapter that had opened with the end of the Second Punic War and that had made the peninsula for the first time the economic centre of the world to the west of Mesopotamia. Some believe that this sad fate is limited to coastal Etruria. Let us leave this illusion to those who have no direct experience of the archaeological and agricultural landscapes of the other regions of central and southern Italy. It is possible that late antiquity, too, had its rationalities, beauties and riches in Italy, but as yet no one can tell us exactly where. So far are only clear the signs of the ruin and decay of the extraordinary pomarium that had been the Italy of villas.1\n\nThose who argue for a crisis point to archaeological evidence such as the reorganization of villas into smaller quarters, poor repairs, and the functional repurposing of elegant rooms as signs of crisis in these settlements (Marzano, 2007, p. 199). On the other hand, Garnsey (2014, pp. 86–87) contends that there is insufficient evidence to support the notion of a crisis in wine production or agriculture during the 2nd and early 3rd centuries CE. Taking an intermediate stance, Domenico Vera (2020) proposes that the crisis may have been exaggerated in historical literature and should be viewed more as a transformation. He challenges the simplistic dichotomy of decline versus prosperity and suggests that while certain localized areas, such as Thyrrenian Italy, experienced a crisis, other regions demonstrated signs of productive growth in the 2nd and 3rd centuries, reaching their peak during the Constantinian period and beyond. Among these, northern Apulia, inland Sannio, and coastal Lucania. Vera’s viewpoint aligns in this respect with Garnsey’s, as the latter believes that the decline in villas was not ubiquitous or did not occur simultaneously in all regions. In southern Etruria the number of villas diminished during the Antonine period, but they were still productive in other areas in the 3rd century—in Latium (around Rome), in the ager Falernus (Campania), and in southern Italy (Garnsey, 2014, p. 87; Goffredo and Volpe, 2018; Lafon, 1994; Vera, 2020, p. 221; Volpe, 2017, 2014). Vera also challenges the notion that a decline in viniculture automatically implies a general agricultural decline. He suggests that the changes observed may be attributed to a shift in production rather than a decline in overall agricultural output. Cereal and animal farming, for instance, do not show signs of decay (Corbier, 1991; Spurr, 1986). The widespread abandonment of villas during this period can perhaps be understood in a different context. First, the progressive and widespread concentration of properties in the hands of senatorial families or of the imperial fiscus must have played a role in this process. Annalisa Marzano (2007, p. 215) showed how some coastal and maritime villas during the mid-empire changed ownership and were transferred to the fiscus through testamentary legacies. These villas were probably not used anymore as a residential retreat since imperial slaves or freedmen were appointed as overseer of these properties. Second, the concentration and reorganization of properties often lacked geographical continuity, posing challenges to their management. Towards the end of the 3rd century, forms of indirect tenancy increased, where plots of land were rented out to large tenants to large (conductores) and small tenants (coloni) (Fabbri et al., 2015; Marcone and Lo Cascio, 2018). Long-term rental contracts, known as emphytheusis, also became more common, continuing into the 4th century, and primarily targeted imperial properties that had become too extensive to be effectively managed, rather than lands that had declined due to neglect (Whittaker and Garnsey, 1997, p. 283). Vera (2020, p. 330) considers this period as a turning point in the Italian agricultural landscape. Villas transformed into centres for the management of scattered plots of land (massa fundorum) and expanded their storage capacity for agricultural produce. For example, the villa in via Gabinia in Rome underwent modifications during the late imperial phase, including the addition of a long building identified as a storing facility (Marzano, 2007, p. 213). The concentration of properties during the late antique period did not always result in centralisation. Instead, a prominent agrarian structure that emerged during this time was the massa fundorum. It represents an agglomeration of properties with varying types, which may or may not have productive links between them (Vera, 1999). The reorganisation of the rural landscape during this period also led to changes in the hierarchy of settlement patterns, resulting in a growing number of pagi and vici. These settlements were inhabited by peasants who worked the lands of the villas’ fundi or coloni. The number of vici particularly increased in southern Italy, and many of these were connected to territories previously occupied by villas. In some instances, they were even established in the locations of abandoned villas from the 2nd to 3rd centuries, with their maximum expansion occurring in the 4th and 5th centuries.\nThe transition to the colonate system may also have been fostered by the slave crisis of the 2nd and 3rd centuries, indirectly caused by the reduction and slowdown of Roman military expansionism (Oliva, 1962). Marx, a prominent proponent of what Kyle Harper (2013, p. 167) calls the “conquest thesis”, argued for a larger availability of slaves in the later Republic due to expansionist wars. This idea was already proposed by David Hume (1987[1758]) earlier, in his essay ‘On the Populousness of Ancient Nations’. The concept of increased slave labour driven by the demand for specific commodities, particularly wine, has been resilient in historiography and was embraced by neo-Marxists and modernist scholars such as Carandini (Harper, 2013, p. 169). The slave crisis of the 2nd and 3rd centuries cannot be solely attributed to the halt of Roman expansionism. The slave mode of production was already experiencing an internal crisis due to the inherent contradictions of the system, leading to rising supervising costs (Morley, 1996). The impact of the slave crisis varied across different regions, with a more pronounced effect in areas where slave-run villas were prevalent, such as Thyrrenian Italy (Marzano, 2007). In contrast, northern Italy had a higher concentration of small and medium-sized farms and fewer slave-run villas (Ortalli, 1996). Furthermore, it should be considered that not all villas exclusively relied on slave labour. Many estates employed a combination of slave labour, hired seasonal workers, and tenants for their management (Marzano, 2007, p. 229; Rathbone, 1981). The idea of a transition from slavery to a quasi-feudal mode of production has faced criticism from Harper (2013), who argues that Rome remained a slave society in the 4th century and dismisses Vera’s discussion of “slave tenancy” or “slave families” as an intermediate step towards colonate (and the medieval feudalism). He argues that these ideas are dependent on the Marxist ‘conquest thesis’ and fail to consider mechanisms of supply and demand and, more importantly, the labour market. According to the historian, the colonate is in fact a “historiographical myth” (Harper, 2013, p. 169). The primary reason for the eventual decline of slavery that he indicates is instead the decrease in demand: “as the Roman imperial system unraveled, slavery became less prominent in precisely the two sectors that made Roman slavery exceptional: sub-elite households and agricultural estates” (Harper, 2011, p. 66). The evidence of plant and animal remains in the archaeological record cannot further this argument, as labour exploitation (in whatever form) leaves no material archaeological evidence (Costambeys, 2009; Sarris, 2009, pp. 7–8).\nHowever, it was essential to provide a background on the situation in the Italian countryside during this period, considering that much historiography has focused on this specific debate rather than exploring other topics (more related to this work) such as crop selection. What is important to note here is that if there was an economic depression during this period, it was not solely caused by the slave crisis. As highlighted by Chris Wickham (1984), the state coffers were already suffering from tax evasion by wealthy landowners. This factor, combined with other economic dynamics and factors at play, likely contributed to the overall economic conditions of the time.\nThe second phase in the transformation of villas, as identified by Munro (2012), is the monumentalisation phase, which occurred around the 4th century. During this period, many surviving villas underwent radical architectural and decorative transformations, particularly the residential ones. Simultaneously, other villas were abandoned. Numerous monumentalised villas were strategically located in fertile lands with panoramic views, often in proximity to main communication systems. Examples of such villas include Casteldebole (Bologna), Faragola (Apulia), San Giusto (Apulia), Villa del Casale (Piazza Armerina, Sicily), Villa di Massenzio (on the via Appia, Lazio, an imperial residential villa monumentalised in the 4th century), Desenzano sul Garda (Lombardy), and Masseria Ciccotti (Basilicata) (Sfameni, 2006, p. 28). In some cases, the monumentalisation involved the restructuring of previously declining or abandoned villas from the 2nd and 3rd centuries. For example, the new 4th-5th century villa at S. Giovanni di Ruoti was installed on a previously abandoned building (Buck and Small, 1994), and the same occurred with several farmsteads and minor villas in northern Apulia, where the productive areas were enhanced during the 4th-5th centuries (Posta Crusta, La Minoia, Avicenna, and more) (Vera, 1995, p. 344). Giuliano Volpe (1996) explains the simultaneous rarefaction and growth of villas as a deliberate choice, with certain villas becoming the directional centres of land properties. This viewpoint is also shared by Vera (1995, p. 194), who believes that this process is part of a general transformation of the agrarian system. The monumentalisation of villas has been attributed to the increasing preference of elite members to reside in the countryside rather than in the city (Sfameni, 2006, p. 22). The emergence of large villas, referred to as praetoria, between the 4th and 5th centuries in the Western part of the Roman Empire, has been linked to forms of self-representation by the elite (Lewit, 2003; Sfameni, 2005). These villas indeed do not exhibit an organic relationship with the pars rustica. Further evidence of the aristocrats’ increased urge for self-representation can be found in the letters of two writers of this period, Symmachus and Sidonius Apollinaris, which show the authors’ preoccupation with issues of power and reputation (Grey, 2011, pp. 9–10). The available documentation from this period has sparked debates among historians regarding the role of slavery in rural villas, part of which has already been discussed above. Vera (2012, p. 112) is convinced that slavery was not a major component in Italian agricultural production at this point. Instead, these villas likely functioned as coordinating and stocking centres. For example, Villa del Casale in Sicily featured a large horreum frumentarium found near the entrance of the villa (Pensabene, 2010). The reorganisation of the countryside with sparser villas and the addition of stocking structures also suggests a shift in production from cash crops to cereal farming (Vera, 2020, p. 231). This transition is evident in locations such as Luni, where vineyards were abandoned on the hills while cereal farming persisted in the plains (Delano Smith et al., 1986). Similarly, around Farfa (Sabina), wine and olive fields appear to have been converted to cereal production (Leggio and Moreland, 1986).\nIn the 5th century, the residential villa model (praetoria) faced a crisis, albeit with varying modalities and timing in different regions (Sfameni, 2012). One notable characteristic of these villas is the presence of re-use and recycling phases, indicating a continuity of occupation that extends into the early medieval period (Munro, 2012, p. 353; Turchiano and Volpe, 2016; Volpe and Turchiano, 2012). The presence of squatters in these abandoned villas has been hypothesised, although this notion is highly debated in more recent literature (Castrorao Barba, 2020; Munro, 2020, 2012). Tamara Lewit has promoted a revision of the traditional paradigm of decline, which Bryan Ward-Perkins (2006, pp. 87–169) could see so clearly in the material and housing culture of Late Antiquity. Lewit (2005; 2004, pp. 256–260; 2003) described the transformation of the villas as a result of the different cultural and ideological values of the elite after their conversion to Christianity. Additionally, Volpe et al. (2009) suggest that the structural changes observed in former Roman villas are not solely a result of different values but are influenced by various factors, including the Gothic War, the crisis of central power in Rome, and other elements contributing to the aristocracies’ impoverishment. However, it is important to keep in mind an important datum: the frequency of villa re-use is relatively low compared to the number of abandoned settlements. Angelo Castrorao Barba (2014a, p. 264) demonstrates that only 26% of Italian villas were reused out of a total of 1,850 case studies. The discussion of the structural changes in the villas during this period is extensive, but is not the subject of this study. For a more comprehensive insight, we recommend the seminal works of Brogiolo (1996), Brogiolo et al. (2005), Castrorao Barba (2020), Christie (2004), Dodd (2019), and Ripoll and Arce (2000).\nImportantly, research has shown how the chronology of the abandonment of Italian villas is not homogeneous. While Thyrrenian Italy seems to be the first to be in decadence, where territories are abandoned along with a demographic crisis (Vera, 2020, p. 330), in other areas such as southern Italy, villas seem to be in use at least until the 6th – 7th century. The reasons for this longer prosperity are manifold and complex. Carla Sfameni (2006, p. 167) asserts that the emergence of large residential buildings in the south in the 4th century has to indicate a positive economic trend already in the 3rd century. She criticises the pre-1950s historiography that saw an agricultural and economic decline of southern Italy and Sicily during the imperial age, which worsened in the late imperial period. Later work by F. De Robertis (1972, 1951) and by Lelia Cracco Ruggini (1995) reevaluated southern economy suggesting opposite trends, especially for cereal farming in Apulia. Much of this positive growth has been attributed to the diversion of annona coming from Egypt to the new capital, Constantinople in the early 4th century. At this time, Italy needed a new productive centre for cereal distributions. Northern Africa, Sicily, and Apulia were obvious choices, given the large amount of available plains, and started exporting large quantities of grain (Volpe, 1996). In the words of Volpe and Turchiano (2010), “the 5th century was for southern Italy – or for at least some areas within it – not only a period which saw the maintenance of order brought about during the late 3rd and 4th centuries AD, but also of expansion”. Vera (2020, p. 330) hypothesised that the state did not promote specialisms in certain areas, rather, it required produce from where there was already an abundance. Northern Apulia, notably the endpoint of a transhumance circuit, also became a core centre of wool production. Lucania et Bruttii, became large producers of pig, hosting a wide forested area. Calabria and Sicily were producing vina fiscalia (wine destined to the free imperial distributions to citizens). The destination of Apulian grain is debated, as probably until the 5th century the annona on southern Italy was only related to wine and pork production, while the grain must have been destined to the Danube military region or Cisalpina, areas that are easy to reach on the Adriatic maritime route. Whatever the destination, this southern prolonged prosperity opened up the doors for senatorial investments. The area was more secure, a central place in the Mediterranean, close to infrastructures and Rome itself, not to mention the fact that investing in agricultural produce (especially cereals) was a good strategy in times of monetary inflation (Sfameni, 2006, pp. 168–169).\nLate antique historians have traditionally focused less on the topic of peasant societies, with the scholarly debate primarily centred around slaves and coloni, as mentioned earlier. The literary sources available from this period often present images of the elite, providing limited insights into the lives of small-scale peasants. At present, the most valuable source of information regarding the experiences of peasants in late antiquity can be found in the papyrological evidence from Egypt. These documents, such as petitions and legal records, offer glimpses into the lives of peasants, albeit with potential biases and limitations in terms of representativeness. In particular, the nature of these records can skew our perspective in favour of interpreting peasants in subaltern positions, as they often highlight conflicts, disputes, and struggles (Grey, 2011, pp. 4–7). One interesting historiographical work that specifically examines the late Roman peasantry is Cam Grey (2011)‘s “Constructing Communities in the Late Roman Countryside.” The book explores the concept of “small politics,” emphasizing the networks of mutual support and social dynamics within peasant societies that are often overlooked in fiscal documents. Grey’s research highlights the agency of peasants, as they adeptly navigate and negotiate against aristocratic claims, particularly in the western regions. While the book primarily focuses on the social and political aspects of peasant life, it does not delve into farming strategies. Instead, it centres on legal disputes and litigations to discuss the intricate dynamics within these communities. Archaeological projects that directly target peasant and non-elite pathways, as was the case in ’The Roman Peasant Project’ (Bowes, 2020), are still missing in late antique archaeology. As a result, explicit crop selection models specific to this period have not been extensively developed. Nonetheless, scholars acknowledge a general shift from cash crops to cereal farming during this era. However, the precise pathways, timing, and spatial patterns of this agricultural transition remain unclear. Additionally, there is a lack of comprehensive, peninsula-wide perspectives on stock raising during the late antique period. While some regional studies, particularly focused on northern Apulia (Buglione et al., 2016; Buglione et al., 2015; Volpe et al., 2012; Volpe, 1996), provide insights into specific areas, there is a dearth of comprehensive synthesis works that encompass the entirety of the late Roman period.\n\n\n2.1.3 The early medieval phase and the 11th century\nIf late antique historians have focused on questions of slavery, tenancy, and landownership, two broad conflicting opinions have dominated the post-1950 discourse on the post-classical landscape. The first stresses continuities with the former Roman and late Roman structures and economic system, and the other emphasizes dramatic rupture from said systems. Pierre Toubert (1973) was among the first to argue for continuities in settlement patterns until the 10th-11th century CE, when contemporary documents begin to describe new types of fortified settlements called castelli or castra. Toubert (1973, pp. 321–338) used textual sources to outline the evolution from ‘dispersed households’ of the 6th-7th century CE (casalia), to 9th century CE manors (curtes), culminating in 10th-11th century CE castles (castelli). The opinion that castles originated from curtes is also shared by the historian Vito Fumagalli (1980, p. 318), who in turn believes that manors developed especially in northern Italy in the Carolingian period. After centuries of alleged uncultivated standstill, the incastellamento (the process of creation of castles) made an agricultural revival possible, with new lands beginning to be cultivated around castles (Toubert, 1973, pp. 157–198). The scholarly focus on continuity vis-à-vis rupture also intersected with the study of the economic history in this period. Henri Pirenne ([1939] 2008) provided a long-lasting contribution to this matter in his work “Mohammed and Charlemagne”, which looked at documentary sources (primarily related to traders) and numismatic evidence. Pirenne argued against the traditional view on the end of the Roman imperial systems of economy and culture shared across the Mediterranean. This view overemphasized the impact of 4th-6th century CE Germanic migrating tribes. Pirenne ([1939] 2008, pp. 54–70) claimed that such tribes could not have had a fundamental impact on Roman-style institutions and trading connections, extending the life of the Classical world up to the 7th century CE. He argued that life on the countryside and systems of agriculture remained the same. In this model, even the great Roman estates survived (Pirenne, [1939] 2008, pp. 75–76). Indeed, the literary sources point us to a continuity not only in assets in some cases, but also in the attitudes held by the ruling class. An example of a particularly well-known landowner in the records of the age of Theodoric, Ostrogoth king, is Theodad, his nephew. Theodad owned an extensive massa fundorum which was concentrated in Tuscia. The administration of his estates was carried out through the use of actores who were responsible for collecting rents and delivering them to him. This method of administration, as well as Procopius’ somewhat hostile portrayal of Theodad, suggests a continuation of the patterns observed within the senatorial class of the late Roman period (Vera, 2020, p. 208). The traditional view of the postclassical countryside as a landscape destroyed by continuous instabilities and warfare also continued to be challenged by recent scholarship. Arnold H. M. Jones (1964, p. 25) wrote that “the destruction caused by continued civil wars and barbarian invasions must have been immense. Cities were sacked and burned, crops destroyed, cattle driven off, and the population carried away into slavery.” However, as Tamara Lewit (2004, p. 41) points out, only a few literary sources mention destruction to agriculture in this period. Cities were likely the primary target of such violent acts.\nAs was anticipated in the previous section, archaeologists had a different perspective on the transitional landscape and economy at the time of the collapsing villa system and Germanic migrations (Castrorao Barba, 2020). The archaeological discourse emphasises that textual sources can include bias and that scholars should give more consideration to material evidence such as ceramics, settlement patterns, and architecture (Bierbrauer, 1988; Brogiolo, 1983; Costambeys, 2009; Valenti, 2014, 2000; Wickham, 1998). For example, Bryan Ward-Perkins (2006) recognised the decline of living standards during the late Antique period through the abundance of coarse pottery, wooden houses, and - most importantly - the disappearance of coinage for everyday use. Chris Wickham (2005, pp. 730–735) also reports a “ceramic breakdown” and deterioration of exchange systems between the 6th and late 9th century CE, when standardised pottery types mostly disappear and only local productions survive (Brogiolo, 1996; Giordani, 1994). Finally, Richard Hodges and David Whitehouse (1983, pp. 36–48) determined, using survey data, a decline in the number of datable sites throughout Italy and a demographic decrease between the beginning of the 5th and the end of the 6th century CE. Fabio Giovannini (2010, pp. 218–219) also argues for a demographic stagnation from the 6th century until the 12th-13th century, and reports no prolonged famines or epidemics from the 8th to the 14th century. During this period, demographic pressure was low, particularly in rural areas. Various factors contributed to this decline. While traumatic events may have had an immediate impact on population numbers, their long-term effects are usually limited. Other factors, such as an extended period of breastfeeding for children (from 4-8 months in the Roman age to up to 2 years in the medieval period), likely influenced the number of children in rural communities (Giovannini, 2010, 2005). In the Roman era, it is estimated that rural families had an average of six children, whereas from the 4th to the 6th century, the average must have been around three (Giovannini, 2010, p. 230). Despite the decrease in population, osteological analyses indicate an improvement in nutrition and diet, with fewer skeletons displaying pathologies related to these factors. Giovannini (2010) attributes this improvement to a more diverse subsistence diet compared to the Roman era. This aspect will be further explored later in this chapter. While Giovannini suggests stagnation until the 12th century, Di Muro (2020, pp. 13–14) argues for an increase in population around the time of Liutprand, the king of the Lombards, in the 8th century, following the plagues and conflicts that occurred during the Justinian era. In a status quaestionis on the discipline of Medieval Archaeology in Italy, Marco Valenti (2014, p. 123) stated that the debate was monopolized in the 1990s by the “Tuscan model” because of the larger availability of archaeological data from this region. The “Tuscan model” was put forth by archaeologists Riccardo Francovich and Hodges (2003, p. 21), who argued that Toubert’s textual model was flawed because a break had already occurred in the 6th-7th century CE, when peasant communities moved to hilltop locations and created fenced farms. The model posits that the choice of hilltops was probably dictated by necessity because after the Greco-Gothic war, unconstrained farmers decided to cluster for protection. Only later, under Carolingian rule, did villages develop hierarchies and become curtes. Lastly, the phenomenon of incastellamento in the 10th-11th century CE, merged manorial functions with landscape management (Valenti, 2014, pp. 130–131). The “Tuscan Model” clashed with the idea (popularised by Marc Bloch, 1966, pp. 1–5) that Roman villas were at the root of modern villages (Cheyette, 2008, p. 129). Following the intensification of excavations in the late 1990s, the “Tuscan model” received criticism, especially by Gian Pietro Brogiolo, who considered the case of Tuscany as an anomaly, because in Tuscany aristocratic weakness facilitated the creation of hilltop villages by free-moving farmers (Valenti, 2014, pp. 131–135). In 2004, there was a confrontation between the two sides of this debate when Francovich, Brogiolo and Valenti held an unpublished conference in Poggibonsi titled “Scavi fortunati e invisibilità archeologica” (Insegnamento di Archeologia Medievale e dell’Alto Medioevo, 2004). The title was chosen polemically after Brogiolo defined the excavations in Tuscany as circumstantially “lucky” because the structured network of Tuscan settlements must have complemented centres of power. Francovich opened the heated discussion by stating that Toubert’s continuity model (still supported by Brogiolo and other scholars) was merely based upon documentary evidence from about eight castles dated around the 10th century CE. According to Francovich, a small piece of land in Tuscany could provide better information than the entire work of Toubert (Valenti, 2014, pp. 132–136; 2009, pp. 40–42). Recently, the picture seems clearer because of historical and archaeological comparative work in the Italian peninsula. It now seems that the role of monastic foundations in the control of the countryside is undeniable because these institutions were more open to economic exchanges and agricultural exploitation than other aristocratic landowners, who were more interested in a military control of the landscape. Monasteries were often connected to a vast network of curtes, which were large tracts of land divided into two parts: the dominicum and the pars massaricia. The dominicum referred to the administrative and residential area of the estate, while the pars massaricia designated the portion dedicated to free or semi-free peasants. The origin of the manorial system of curtes has been a subject of debate among scholars. Some argue for continuities with the Roman villa-system (Francovich and Hodges, 2003), while others, as mentioned earlier, propose a significant shift in landownership patterns. A detailed discussion of this topic is beyond the scope of this chapter. What is important to note is that during the Lombard period, both the southern and northern duchies (although the sources richest in information are from Tuscany) provide examples of large manors already featuring a division between dominicum and pars massaricia. The figures for the average size of such estates remain uncertain, although a curtis could be valued at up to 8,000 solidi, as seen in the case of the 8th century estate of Alfiano sull’Oglio (Brescia). Nonetheless, most historians agree that curtes became more structured and widespread during the Frankish era. Wickham (2009) supports this idea, arguing that Lombard possessores were economically weaker compared to their Frankish counterparts. In contrast, Di Muro (2020) points out that this view may be biased— if most of the Lombard curtes reported in the documentary sources were private, the Carolingian estates studied so far mostly belonged to the royal fiscus. Wickham’s perspective notwithstanding, there are other historians, such as Bruno Andreolli and Massimo Montanari (1985), who highlight how corvées (unpaid labour obligations) fully developed during the Frankish period. Indeed, the demands made by landlords on peasants during the Lombard age were much more vague and general. In their view, corvées serve as indicators of a stronger control exerted by landlords over the manor. Towards the end of the Lombard era, we find references to the operae (labour) that free peasants had to perform for their landlords, as seen in the case of Totone di Campione (Gasparri and La Rocca, 2005). Although rare, there are instances of Lombard peasant obligations, which are less likely to be recorded since much of the information we have on Carolingian curtes comes from polyptychs. Polyptychs are documents that describe the lands and possessions of a landlord, which were not used during the Lombard age (Di Muro, 2020, p. 24). The role of monastic foundations in the network of curtes becomes evident when examining examples from the southern Lombard duchy of Benevento. One of the best studied complexes is Santa Sofia di Benevento, established around 760 CE by Duke Arechi II. In 774 CE, the duke bestowed upon the coenobium numerous lands and productive activities, including the saltpans of Salpi, a wood collection forest in Ascoli Satriano, a chalk mine in Nurano, various animal farms, and more (Martin, 2000). Among the properties donated to Santa Sofia was the former Roman villa of Faragola (Apulia), which underwent reorganization in the mid-7th century to enhance production and optimize spatial arrangement, particularly in handling farm produce (Volpe et al., 2009). Situated on the road to Benevento, it is likely that some of its goods were destined for that city. In 2001, Jean-Pierre Devroey (2001, p. 97) hypothesized that between the 5th and 11th century CE, ninety percent of the Italian population was living in a subsistence economy in the countryside. In general, though, the topic of rural economy is sparse in historical and archaeological literature. As Fredric Cheyette (2008, pp. 127–129) noted, only one volume in the series titled “The transformation of the Roman world” (Barceló and Sigaut, 2004) is devoted to the rural economy. The neglect of rurality by historians and archaeologists is partially to be ascribed to a “primitivism approach”2 (Castillo, 2014, p. 2), which is still significant in southern European academia. This approach argues for the return to a simpler form of economy and that this simplification is what brought on other changes in the early medieval social structure. Wickham (2005, p. 534), in talking about peasant autonomy, made an interesting point about agricultural production in the framework of the “Tuscan model”. The author claimed that after the 5th century CE, peasants did indeed operate in small circles of subsistence economy, but they had acquired more autonomy and responsibilities in farming production than in Roman times:\n\nIn a pattern of this kind, landlords are largely cut out of the productive process, for peasants make their own choices about agricultural planning and its rhythms. Almost all that changes is the type of rent, as well (of course) as its weight. In the early Middle Ages, most rents from peasants were in kind, and reflected the range of agricultural products available on any given tenant plot: the simplest type of rent structure, one that does not require any wider economic relationships to work (Wickham, 2002, p. 129).\n\nIf we exclude rents, peasants were liberated of former farming priorities, such as generating a surplus for taxation, and thus they did not have to meet external demands any longer. To provide context for this statement, it is useful to outline these former farming priorities. During the late Roman Empire, between the rule of Septimius Severus and Diocletian, most of the Roman soldier salary (stipendium) was converted into wheat provisions. The state secured this distribution of grain to the soldiers (annona militaris) by taxing in kind the farmers. In times of peace, farmers would have been refunded of these wheat requisitions. However, in case of military necessities (as most of the times during the late Roman age) the requisitions acted as a form of taxation (Carrié, 1989, pp. 100–102). The aforesaid concept of late antique peasant autonomy remained constant until the manor system was fully implemented in the 8th century CE. In conjunction with the development of curtes, the study of material culture also suggests that the date of economic development in the Italian countryside should sit at around the 8th-9th century CE (Valenti, 2014, p. 138), coinciding with the late Lombard and Frankish age. Adriaan Verhulst (1966) had already demonstrated the late origins of the manor system in France, but Wickham (2005, pp. 280–281) argued for the presence of manors in northern Italy and Tuscany as well.\nIn the previous sections, we discussed the importance of crop selection models in understanding peasant choices and the subsequent economic consequences. Although explicit crop selection models are still missing for the postclassical Italian countryside, the subject has been discussed by historians at greater lengths for this period when compared to the late Roman phase. In particular, the discussion has especially focused around Tuscany, where many agrarian contracts have been studied, and northern Italy in general, where there are more available archaeobotanical analyses. Bruno Andreolli (1981) studied 8th-10th century agrarian contracts, reporting over 500 documents for Tuscany, most of which are from 9th century Lucca. Out of these 500 contracts, 195 mention some sort of payment in kind with foodstuffs, either of vegetable or animal origin. For cereal and legumes, two types of payment are mentioned in the sources—a fixed and a partial quota. The former refers to a fixed weighted amount of produce, while the second is typically one third of the total. According to Andreolli, partial quotas are typical of plains, which were dedicated to cereal farming, whereas fixed quotas are typical of mountains, hills, and less productive areas. For instance, in the area of Garfagnana and Lunigiana the contracts from Sillano, Gorfigliano, and Cascio3 report fixed quotas. Examples of partial quotas appear in most of the 9th-10th century polyptychs from the monasteries of San Colombano di Bobbio and Santa Giulia di Brescia (Montanari, 1979, pp. 166–172). The prevalence of contracts mentioning partial quotas in highly productive areas is also evidenced by one of the most cited products in such documents, wine. Payment for this product is always requested in kind, most often half of the production. In addition to wine, half of the production of olives is also a common request. It is significant that the contracts mention olives always as a raw material, almost never in the form of olive oil, probably for reasons of necessity. Owning olive presses must have been a huge commodity for a farmer, and it is unlikely that all farmers had access to these structures. Besides these products, documents also mention chestnuts, hay, acorns, and other foodstuff. Payments in the form of animals are often vague in contracts, especially in the Lombard period, where the species requested are often not specified. Other times, there is instead mention of specific animals—pigs, goats, sheep, cows, and chickens. In many of these cases the animal had to be ‘annotino’, i.e. one year old. In the transition from the 8th to the 9th century, contracts became more specific, requiring only specific parts of the pig, such as the shoulder. In the 10th century these forms of payment in kind seem to fade away, probably as ‘old’ Lombard practices were gradually abandoned. More generally, Andreolli (1990) sees arboriculture as the real novelty of the early Middle Ages in Italy. According to the historian, cereal farming in this period was not very productive and the drive towards innovation and improved yields was minimal. In other words, while historiography has focused on cereals as the fundamental productive component of early medieval agrarian systems, orchards have often been ignored and thus our judgement on the profitability of agriculture of this period could only have been negative. The importance of the orchard is also understandable in view of the growing importance of urban gardens in this period. Recently, early medieval historiography is increasingly focusing on this topic, both in Italy and elsewhere (Davies, 2019; Goodson, 2018). In the early Middle Ages, the word hortus could refer to various situations: urban or suburban gardens, gardens in the dominical part of a curtis, and monastic gardens. Contrary to more pessimistic theses that read the progressive ruralisation of cities as a sign of decay compared to the Roman age, the spread of vegetable gardens in the early Middle Ages can instead be read in terms of economic rationale and practicality. Firstly, documentation especially from northern and central Italy explicitly states that vegetable gardens are not subject to taxation. The only exception to this rule were legumes, which were subject to taxation as they were regularly cultivated in the fields. Among the most requested legumes in this period, fava beans were often indicated in the taxes and agrarian contracts from S. Giulia di Brescia, Lucca, and Verona (Andreolli, 1990, pp. 184–185). Caroline Goodson (2021) in her recent work on early medieval urban gardens has pointed out that the greater diffusion of kitchen gardens in postclassical Italian cities is not a symptom of economic decline, but rather a different way to conceive urban spaces4. The transition from the unproductive and ornamental gardens of the Roman era to intensively cultivated horti denotes the utilitarian mentality of early medieval man. The increased availability of space in the cities, a safer and more accessible food supply, and investment in fruit plants in the medium and long term all contributed to this phenomenon. Urban gardens spread in Rome (especially between the 6th and the 8th century), Lucca, Naples, Ferrara, Verona, and other cities. One of the scholars who has been most concerned with agricultural practices and diet in the early Middle Ages, implicitly formulating models of peasant cultivation is Massimo Montanari. Most of his observations are based on documents from northern Italy and France, and he is among the historians who have most popularised the idea of polyculture in the early Middle Ages. According to Montanari, the agricultural system shifted towards a more decentralized approach, contrasting with the centralized system of the Roman imperial period. This shift likely had implications for the types of crops cultivated during the early medieval era. In northern Italy, Montanari (1979) emphasizes the significance of “minor” grains among the cereals cultivated during this period. However, the term “minor” cereal poses some challenges, as it is used in literature to refer to different types of grains. Montanari’s definition includes rye, emmer, einkorn, spelt, sorghum, and millets as minor cereals. Other historians (Andreolli, 1990; Spurr, 1986, 1983) have employed this term to refer to cereals with lower yields and economic value, leading to the conclusion that such grains were exclusively consumed by the lower classes. In contrast, archaeobotanists like Elisabetta Castiglioni and Mauro Rottoli (2010) restrict the definition to C4 plants, specifically sorghum and millets. Some researchers exclusively apply the term to hulled wheats, while others, such as Paolo Squatriti (2019), adopt a more cautious approach and describe these grains as more “rustic.” Regardless of how one defines these grains, historians and archaeologists are in agreement that, at least in northern Italy, a transition from extensive agricultural systems to intensive polyculture took place. Notably, rye has been recognized as a significant innovation during the early Middle Ages, and its importance will be further explored later in this study. Rye is the predominant cereal in an early 10th century polyptych from Santa Giulia di Brescia, which showcases a diverse range of crops including rye, wheat, broomcorn millet, foxtail millet, barley and oats, spelt, and legumes (Montanari, 1979, p. 111). In the document, secale accounts for 2408.39 modii (39.44%), nearly double the quantity of frumentum (1234 modii, 20.21%). The idea of an early medieval peasant society based on subsistence and polyculture is also widespread among transalpine historians. Jean-Pierre Devroey (Devroey, 2019, p. 857), traces the causes of this phenomenon to the exemption of taxes, following Wickham’s (Wickham, 2005, pp. 535–547) theory of peasant autonomy:\n\nSoulagés de l’obligation de produire des surplus pour la commercialisation et le paiement de l’impôt, les paysans ont obtenu plus de liberté pour organiser leurs activités économiques suivant des logiques qui leur étaient propres.\n\nIn addition to this factor, he also considers the numerous advantages of “minor” grains against climatic adversities, which will be discussed in the next section. In particular, the Belgian historian sees these cereals as markers of rural or “village” productions, as opposed to the seigneurial productions of common bread wheat (Devroey, 2019, pp. 864–867). This idea, as already evident from the polyptych of the powerful monastery of Brescia, likely does not apply to Italy. Although Montanari’s focus primarily revolved around cereals, legumes, and meat as the main components of the diet, it is essential to acknowledge the significant role played by arboriculture during the early Middle Ages, as previously indicated. Fruits cultivation seem to have an increased importance also in other areas of the Mediterranean—a recent archaeobotanical study (Marston and Castellano, 2023) showed how arboriculture increased through the early Byzantine period (mid-4th to mid-9th century CE) in Anatolia. Among fruits, the introduction (or popularisation) of chestnut trees was another innovation of this period. Despite being categorized as “spontaneous” fruits, chestnut trees were intentionally planted for productive purposes, a practice suggested in the Capitulare de Villis, a text from the late 8th century that offered guidance on the management of Charlemagne’s royal estates (Montanari, 1979, p. 296). Chestnuts replaced many of the spontaneous forested areas in northern Italy, in the Po valley, and in Campania (Squatriti, 2013). The fruits could be dried and stored, then ground and used as flour for bread (Castiglioni and Rottoli, 2015, pp. 55–56). Alongside the cultivation of fields and orchards, which included also vineyards and olive trees, sylvo-pastoral activities were also practised during this period. These activities often held a prominent position, particularly in the exploitation of the incoltum, referring to uncultivated areas such as woodlands, natural pastures, moorlands, and marshlands. The expansion of these uncultivated areas occurred as a result of the economic and demographic crisis that took place in late antiquity. In response to this expansion, people quickly adapted by utilising the forests for various purposes. They gathered wood for construction, collected mushrooms, herbs, and roots, engaged in hunting, and utilised streams and other water sources for fishing. The natural pastures provided grazing opportunities for sheep, goats, and cattle. Quite notably, the extension of forests during this period was often assessed based on their capacity to support pig populations. Pigs were commonly allowed to roam freely under oak trees in both plains and mountains, as they could feed on acorns (Kreiner, 2020; Montanari, 2015).\n\n\n\nThe depiction of the month of November from Très riches heures du Duc de Berry. Although the manuscript illumination is dated to 1412-1416, it is a good example of how humans were managing the forested landscape for wood pasture. Image after Colombe and Ojéda (2023).\n\n\nEvidence from archaeobotanical analyses in various regions of Europe supports the presence of mixed farming strategies. For example, in southern France, alongside the cultivation of cereals, pulses such as fava beans, lentils, peas, and chickpeas were also grown (Ruas, 2005). This indicates a diverse agricultural system that incorporated both grains and legumes. In northern France and southern Netherlands, the transition from the Merovingian to the Carolingian period did not significantly affect crop choices. A free three-course crop rotation system5 was consistently practised, with oats, rye, barley, and bread wheat being the most commonly cultivated cereals (Bakels, 2005). This suggests a stable agricultural tradition focused on these staple crops. Additionally, the cultivation of grapes emerged as a prevalent practice for fruit production in both southern and northern France. In England, the FeedSax project showed how during the 9th to 13th century, the cultivation of low-input cereals played a significant role in enabling landowners to accumulate wealth and exert greater control over peasant populations (Hamerow et al., 2020; Hamerow and McKerracher, 2022). In the Iberian Peninsula, a recent overview of the published archaeobotanical data (Peña-Chocarro et al., 2019) has highlighted increasing fruit tree cultivation during the early medieval period. This trend aligns with the observations made by Andreolli (1990) regarding Italy. In the Italian mainland, there is currently a lack of a comprehensive study based on archaeobotanical evidence that covers the entire region. Instead, studies have primarily focused on specific regions or shorter chronologies, providing valuable insights into localized agricultural practices (Arthur et al., 2012; Bosi et al., 2009; Rottoli, 2014a).\nIt is important to emphasise that this research has a defined earlier chronological boundary, which concludes at the 11th century. Although shorter than the other phases, the 11th century was analysed as a separate phase in the statistical models. Scholars in historical literature have underscored the transitional nature of this century, marking significant changes and developments. One notable transformation during the 10th and 11th centuries is the full development of curtes and the evolution of some of these estates into fortified villages, which occurred at different times and with different modalities across the Italian peninsula (Toubert, 1973; Wickham, 1998, 1985). The motivations behind the construction of fortified structures by both lords and peasants were driven by defensive and economic considerations (Augenti and Galetti, 2018; Wickham, 1985). Following the so-called ‘second invasions’ by Hungarians and Saracens, many landowners, both secular and ecclesiastical, had to organise themselves as best they could in building defensive works, such as moats and palisades. According to Montanari (2014, pp. 220–225), one of the reasons for the Carolingian rulers’ loss of authority in the territory was precisely their inability to offer adequate protection. The landowners also accommodated smallholders and free farmers in their fortified holdings, serving de facto not only patrimonial but also public functions. By the 11th century, lords expanded their power to encompass larger territories and exert control even over individuals who lacked any legal ties to them; what is known as the “territorial signoria” was established (Montanari, 2014, p. 227). This phenomenon led to a centralisation of settlement patterns, with the rural landscape soon adapting to this new situation: cash crops, as vines and olive groves, were concentrated immediately outside the castle walls. This was followed concentrically by other crops, pastures and finally forests. Despite the significant developments in settlement patterns, the primary focus of this section remains on the phenomenon known as the “agricultural revival”, which holds particular significance in the context of this research. According to several scholars, there is evidence of a positive demographic trend emerging from the late 8th and early 9th centuries. This trend is observed through the appearance of documents related to land clearances in regions such as the Po valley, Sabina (near Farfa), and Abruzzo (Wickham, 2002, p. 128). The increasing population pressure during this time necessitated the utilisation of more resources. While certain innovations already surfaced in the 9th century, it was after the year 1000 CE that peasants, liberated from corvées, were able to optimise their time and income by engaging in activities such as the construction of new villas6, land reclamation, and the implementation of new techniques. The expansion of cultivated areas did not only affect Italy. Other areas in continental Europe and the British Isles show signs of rapid cerealisation. As early as the end of the Carolingian Age, cattle and horses as work animals became more important in north-western Europe (Hamerow and McKerracher, 2022, p. 201). In northern France, grain production increased between the 8th and the 12th centuries, as a survey on the number of grain storage structures showed (Peytremann, 2013). In addition to the progressive reduction in unpaid labour requests, Wickham (2002, p. 129) also argues for the existence of an urban market system in the 10th century, where peasants could sell their produce, and for an increase in cash payments rather than payments in kind. Recent research, however, suggests that in northern Italy the number of market regulations increased during the 9th and 10th centuries, but mostly in rural and suburban areas (Rapone, 2011) and that rents in this period were still largely paid in kind (Goodson, 2021, pp. 144–152). Only in the 11th century did the number of urban markets increase, with Carolingian regulations. Textual sources mention not only northern cities such as Verona, Piacenza, Pavia and other towns in the Po Valley, but also fixed markets in Rome, Amalfi, Salerno and Venosa during this period7. These historical documents suggest that by the end of the early Middle Ages, agriculture was once again a booming sector of the economy, rather than merely a subsistence activity."

    "text": "2.2 Environmental archaeology approaches in Italian archaeology\nCurrent understanding of historic landscapes has benefited greatly from the development of environmental archaeology and bioarchaeology in general, particularly with sub-disciplines such as archaeobotany and zooarchaeology. These disciplines have allowed us to re-examine assumptions about food production and consumption in antiquity, revealing that many prior beliefs were not entirely accurate, and the reality was not as black and white as previously thought. Moreover, environmental archaeology is particularly helpful in landscape reconstructions, as it provides evidence of the historical plant and animal species present in a region. The evolution of bioarchaeologies was significantly influenced by the development of the “New Archaeology,” which emerged in the 1960s and will be discussed in more detail in the statistics section of this chapter (Section 2.3). Here, we will provide a historical overview of the disciplines, while delving into their objectives, types, and preservation modes of the remains in Chapter 3 and Chapter 4. In addition, we will also introduce other bioarchaeological proxies useful to the reconstruction of dietary regimes and climatic changes, although this research focuses solely on plant and animal remains. Peregrine Horden and Nicholas Purcell (2000, pp. 287–297) highlighted the lack of palaeobotanical and paleozoological data in the Italian peninsula. Lisa Lodwick and Erica Rowan (2022) conducted a critical overview of archaeobotanical research on Greek and Roman sites, analysing the number of sites with archaeobotanical samples published in the journal Vegetation History and Archaeobotany between 1992 and 2021, along with Environmental Archaeology between 2000 and 2021. The results indicated that North-West Europe had the highest number of sites, followed by Italy and Britain.\n\n\n\nArchaeobotanical articles with a Greek or Roman focus. Image after Lodwick and Rowan (2022, p. 599).\n\n\nArchaeobotany and other bioarchaeological disciplines are more common in prehistorical excavations, whereas zooarchaeology has a longer tradition and is also commonly practised in Italy for excavations relating to historical periods such as the Roman era and later, where ancient sources describe farming practises. Among the regions mentioned in the study above, Britain stands out with the oldest tradition and a more rigorous approach to publishing, although much of the chronological effort is dedicated to earlier periods. In addition to universities in the UK, most commercial archaeology firms collect and examine archaeobotanical samples. Similarly, archaeobotany has been extensively practiced in north-western European nations such as France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, and Switzerland since the 1980s, with commercial archaeology adding significantly to sample availability. In Italy, interest in collecting plant remains dates back to the first excavations of Vesuvian sites in the 18th century. However, most of the conversation on the Italian farmland landscape and dietary studies has relied on literary sources. This reliance on ancient textual sources, specifically referring to Italy, has led to a “false sense of security regarding ancient food and diet. Moreover, unlike some of the very rich assemblages recovered from the northern provinces, many Italian Republican and Imperial period assemblages are small, with low densities and poor preservation of remains, which often discouraged sampling efforts. As a result, outside of the Vesuvian sites, many excavations did not bother sampling” (Lodwick and Rowan, 2022, p. 603). In the 19th century, during large classical excavations like Pompeii, macroremains visible to the eye were collected and sent to natural scientists for interpretation. Wilhelmina F. Jashemski (Jashemski, 2018; Jashemski, 1999, 1979; Jashemski and Meyer, 2002), and later Annamaria Ciarallo (2001, 1992) made notable contributions to the scientific cataloguing of ancient botanical remains in Italy, focusing on the gardens of Pompeiian sites. Additionally, in the 1970s and 1980s, efforts were made to create reconstructions based on botanical materials (Castelletti, 1976, 1972; Costantini, 1983a, 1983b, 1979; Costantini et al., 1983; Follieri, 1971). It was during this period that the technique of flotation was used for the first time at an Italian site, at Passo di Corvo (Foggia) (Follieri, 1973). Since then, several archaeobotanical laboratories have been established in Italy, including those in Modena, Lecce, Rome, and Naples, to name a few. The increased specialisation in both macro- and micro-remains led to the creation of the BRAIN project, an archaeobotanical database for Italy (Mercuri et al., 2015). Although a massive task, the database provides references to published material without quantitative information. Syntheses are also becoming available, focusing on the introduction of specific species, regions, or chronologies. Some significant recent syntheses and studies include Borgongino (2006) for botanical remains in the Vesuvian area, Sadori et al. (2009) on the introduction of peach, Ucchesu et al. (2017) on plum, Caracuta (2020) and D’Auria et al. (2017) on olives, Pagnoux et al. (2013) and Celant and Fiorentino (2018) on citrus. Additionally, Castiglioni and Rottoli (2010) focused on sorghum in northern Italy, whereas Castiglioni and Rottoli (2013) studied broomcorn millet, foxtail millet, and sorghum in north Italian early medieval sites. Grasso and Fiorentino (2009) provided a bibliographical reference for archaeobotanical samples from medieval Italy, and Buonincontri et al. (2017) delved into medieval Tuscany.\nZooarchaeology, similar to archaeobotany, also underwent initial development in the 19th century, where the study of historical fauna was initially conducted by naturalists. During that time, the focus was primarily on the study of ancient animals without exploring questions of historical significance. The importance of archaeological context was often overlooked, and these studies were part of the larger debate between creationists, evolutionists, lamarckists, and darwinists (De Grossi Mazzorin, 2014). It was Pellegrino Strobel (Strobel, 1890, 1882, 1877, 1875; Strobel, 1863) who recognized the significance of faunal remains within archaeological layers, particularly in the context of Middle and Late Bronze Age Terramare. Indeed, to gain historical insights, animal bones must be studied in connection to stratigraphy. Additionally, by examining cut marks on the bones, faunal remains can be used as proxies for food processing and consumption. However, the study of faunal remains in archaeological contexts was predominantly restricted to prehistoric excavations, with these studies often appearing as mere lists attached to excavation reports. After a period of relative stagnation during which Italian archaeology moved away from natural sciences, zooarchaeology experienced a revival, particularly due to debates on the origin of agriculture and animal husbandry, especially abroad. The establishment of the Italian Association of ArchaeoZoology (AIAZ) in the early 1990s played a pivotal role in promoting the sharing of various studies through conferences. Among the notable contributions within the association, the work of Jacopo De Grossi Mazzorin was particularly remarkable, focusing on several species such as chickens, tortoises, and fish (Battafarano and De Grossi Mazzorin, 2006; Corbino et al., 2022; De Grossi Mazzorin et al., 2009; De Grossi Mazzorin, 2006, 2000; De Grossi Mazzorin, 2002; De Grossi Mazzorin and Minniti, 2009a). In recent years, zooarchaeology in Italy has seen an increase in synthesis works, surpassing the availability of such resources in archaeobotany. Noteworthy contributions include a report by Alfredo Riedel (1994), a zooarchaeologist who contributed much to the development of the discipline in Italy. The paper offers comprehensive zooarchaeological excavations data from North Eastern Italy spanning the Neolithic to the Middle Ages. Michael MacKinnon (2004) provided detailed overviews and in-depth studies of Roman period faunal data, integrating it with textual evidence. In a later work, he focused specifically on several contexts in Ostia (MacKinnon, 2014). Moreover, zooarchaeological overviews targeted specific regions like northern Apulia, with contributions from Buglione (2007), De Venuto (2010), Buglione et al. (2016), and Volpe et al. (2012). In addition to Apulia, other Italian areas have been thoroughly studied. Petrucci (2008) presents zooarchaeological findings from Friuli Venezia-Giulia. De Grossi Mazzorin and Minniti (2009b) compiled zooarchaeological data from Rome and Lazio, spanning from prehistory to the classical age. Additionally, a more recent work by the same authors (De Grossi Mazzorin and Minniti, 2022) covers three thousand years of samples from the Iron Age to medieval Rome. A database for medieval Italy was initially proposed by Boscato et al. (2007) at the University of Siena, but unfortunately, it was never completed. Nevertheless, one of the authors, Frank Salvadori (2015), later published some of its data. One of the first contributions that provided digital (raw) supplementary data for the Italian peninsula is in Trentacoste et al. (2021), although the database covers the first millennium BCE. Only very recently, the Schmidtova et al. (2023) RomAniDat dataset provides valuable zooarchaeological information for Italian samples from 800 BCE to 800 CE. Despite the growing importance of environmental archaeology, comprehensive syntheses of Italian regions that integrate archaeobotany with zooarchaeology are relatively scarce. However, Lentjes (2013) conducted a notable study on first millennium BCE Southeast Italy, while Rottoli (2014b) provided a comprehensive overview of early medieval northern Italy, incorporating both botanical and faunal remains. The integration of both types of sources is fundamental for a thorough understanding of landscape change in relation to agriculture.\n\n2.2.1 Diet\nThe reconstruction of ancient dietary customs is increasingly becoming more precise since the 1970s through the use of additional bioarchaeological proxies on top of plant and animal remains. Among these proxies, the analysis of carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes on human bone collagen provides useful information. In contrast to archaeobotany and zooarchaeology, stable isotopes can provide information at an individual level over the course of several years of life (Lubritto et al., 2017; Ricci et al., 2016). This method, first applied in studies by Johann Carl Vogel and Nikolaas J. Van Der Merwe (1978; 1977), operates under the assumption that stable isotopes maintain fixed ratios in nature but can be altered by external factors, including food consumption (Heinrich et al., 2021). The carbon and nitrogen signature of each individual is then used to assess for instance if the human was consuming C3 (e.g. wheat, barley, rice, rye) or C4 (e.g. maize, sorghum, millet, sugarcane) plants, if their diet included terrestrial and marine resources, etc. In particular, the ratio of 13C/12C (∂13C) reflects the proportion of different kinds of plants, while the ratio 15N/14N (∂15N) is indicative of protein consumption (animal foods, mother’s milk, aquatic foods). Higher ∂13C values indicate a higher consumption of C4 plants, while higher ∂15N values reflect a diet that is more based on animal proteins than plants. The interpretation of the isotope ratios is not straightforward, as many confounding elements can be misleading (De Angelis et al., 2020). For instance, having a baseline of the meals the person was eating is helpful. Some fish also have signatures similar to C4 plants, and different animal feeds can alter the isotope values of, for example, a cow, which in turn affects the isotope value of the human being under investigation (Twiss, 2019). The isotope ratios can also be additionally affected by farming practises. It is necessary to understand whether animals were consuming wheat from fields that had been fertilised with dung—human stable isotopes are in fact the product of the complete food chain (what we ate, what was eaten by what we ate, etc.). If so, it is likely that nitrogen was being recycled (Heinrich et al., 2021).\nIn recent times, scholars have been engaged in the compilation of isotope databases. The IsoArch database, created by Kevin Salesse et al. (2018), encompasses information dating from the 12th century BCE to the 8th century CE, with a geographical focus on the Graeco-Roman world. Another significant database, the Compendium Isotoporum Medii Aevi (CIMA), presented in Carlo Cocozza et al. (2022), contains data from both Italy and Europe, spanning the period around 500 CE to 1500 CE. By utilising both the IsoArch and CIMA databases, Cocozza et al. (2022) made noteworthy observations regarding dietary patterns in different regions of Italy. In northern Italy, there appears to be an increase in the consumption of C4 plants between 200 CE and 500 CE. Meanwhile, in central Italy during the same period, there seems to be a decline in protein consumption. These findings corroborate localised studies of stable isotopes conducted in specific regions of the Italian peninsula during the Classical and post-Classical periods. In particular, isotopic evidence has been informative on the significance of marine resources in Roman Italy, especially in areas located close to coastlands as Pompeii or Herculaneum. These findings were not readily evident in traditional zooarchaeological studies, as fish remains are not frequently found on archaeological sites (see Chapter 4 for sampling biases). Finally, the application of stable isotopes has also proven instrumental in shedding light on non-elite diets (Craig et al., 2009; De Angelis et al., 2020; Iacumin et al., 2014; Killgrove and Tykot, 2018, 2013; Rowan, 2022; Soncin et al., 2021).\n\n\n2.2.2 Climate\nEnvironmental archaeology has not only facilitated the reconstruction of consumption and production patterns but also contributed to various other topics. Archaeobotany, for instance, utilises not only macroremains but also microremains such as pollens or non-pollen palynomorphs (NPP) to reconstruct historical landscapes. These microremains serve as proxies for paleoclimate, providing valuable insights into past environmental and vegetation changes (Seppä and Bennett, 2003). Numerous works have explored this direction, continuously publishing syntheses of the obtained data. Particularly, palynology has been instrumental in understanding climatic fluctuations during the first millennium CE. The role of climate in historical landscapes gained considerable scholarly attention, especially when the 16th century CE marked the beginning of a recognized climatic “anomaly”, later known as the “Little Ice Age” (Cheyette, 2014). As the discipline of paleoclimatology advanced, three distinct climatic anomalies were identified in the first millennium. These events are referred to as the “Roman Warm Period” (~ 250 BCE - 200/400 CE), the “Late Antique Little Ice Age” (~ 536-660 CE), and the “Medieval Warm Period” (~ 900-1300 CE).\nThe Roman Warm Period, also known as the “Roman Climatic Optimum”, has been characterized as a period of warm and stable conditions in Italy, southern, and northern Europe from approximately 200 BCE to 200 CE (Ljungqvist, 2010; Van Limbergen and De Clercq, 2021). Although the exact timing of this climatic event remains debated due to various proxies providing different chronologies, evidence suggests relative climatic stability during this period. Some studies have linked this stability to Roman expansionism and positive trends in agricultural production (Harper, 2017). However, it is essential to note that linking historical events to climatic trends is not universally accepted among scholars. Thus, in this review, we will strictly focus on the climatic evidence. Recent research using stalagmites from Bàsura cave in northern Italy indicates a warmer and increasingly humid climate during the Roman Warm Period, followed by a wetter climate around 350 CE (Hu et al., 2022). Furthermore, evidence from various sources includes stable solar activity between 200 BCE and 100 CE, followed by a cooling phase from the 2nd century CE. This cooler phases seems to continue up to 270 CE, as indicated by Greenland ice cores (McCormick et al., 2012). Additionally, evidence shows increased precipitation variability after 250 CE (Büntgen et al., 2011). Reduced sea ice during the Roman Warm Period (Shi et al., 2022) and warmer sea surface temperatures from the 1st to the end of the 5th century in Sicily (Margaritelli et al., 2020) further support this climatic phase. During this period, the spread of viticulture in Britain suggests warmer temperatures (Van Limbergen and De Clercq, 2021). While some scholars describe the period from 200 BCE to 150 CE as “warm, wet, and stable” (Harper, 2017, p. 44) across the Mediterranean, others emphasize the more regional nature of precipitation phenomena and the need to avoid generalisations (Haldon et al., 2018).\nClimate reconstructions show a lasting, large-scale cooling phase in the northern Hemisphere in the 6th and 7th century CE, defined in literature as “Late Antique Little Ice Age” or “Dark Age Cold Period” (Eisenberg et al., 2015, pp. 48–49). Three volcanic events in 536, 540 and 547 CE caused a spread of aerosol particles in the stratosphere, screening the sunlight and causing sea-ice extension (Büntgen et al., 2016). Cassiodorus, a Roman statesman under the Ostrogothic king Theoderic the Great, accounts about a “bluish” sun and mysterious weather in 536 CE: “we have had a winter without storms, a spring without mildness, and a summer without heat […] The seasons have changed by failing to change” (Cassiod., Var., XXV). The bipolar ice core record of volcanism, based on Greenlandic and Antarctic ice caps, confirms high quantities of sulphate deposits in the atmosphere dated 534±2 CE (Sigl et al., 2013). Dendrochronological studies recorded a climatic deterioration in the Mediterranean region between 536 and 660 CE ca., with temperatures cooling down to 1.5°C compared to the average (Büntgen et al., 2016). The late antique climatic anomaly lasted until the 660 CE, around the time in which solar irradiance must have touched its minimum (Steinhilber et al., 2009).\n\n\n\nLeft image. Evidence of LALIA across the northern Hemisphere. Image after Büntgen et al. (2016). Right image. Total Solar Irradiance during the last two millennia. Image after Steinhilber et al. (2009).\n\n\nIn northern Italy, another important climatic event dated 589 CE has been the focus of many studies: the so-called Paul the Deacon deluge, termed after the author of Historia Langobardorum who describes it as the major rainfall since Noah’s times (Paul the Deacon et al., 1878, p. 127). For a long time, the precipitations of the 589 CE have been considered to be the main cause of hydrological change in the Italian north-east (Squatriti, 2010, pp. 799–801). Other scholars have reduced the importance of the 589 CE flooding, emphasizing how the process of riverbed aggradation had already started before the 4th century CE, in Roman times (Cremonini et al., 2013, pp. 170–1; Marchetti, 2002). The two main Italian rivers, the Adige and the Po, were extremely lively in the first half of the first millennium CE, as some prevention works on the river banks show (Squatriti, 2010, p. 816). Evidence of the 589 CE flooding can be found stratigraphically in the alluvial sediments, hard to recognize outside the region of Emilia-Romagna, the alluvial basin of the Po river. However, alluvial layers have been documented in Lombardy, Veneto and Tuscany (Cremonini et al., 2013, p. 175; Zanchetta et al., 2021). In low plains, the consequences of flooding are more visible, with the creation of marshlands, the advancement of the coastline and the development of lagoons (Brogiolo, 2015, p. 50). The study of pollen, NPPs, and seeds showed indeed evidence of devastating floods in northern Italy during late antiquity (Bosi et al., 2019; Squatriti, 2010). The waterlogging from such climatic circumstances is used as evidence for the observable return to subsistence economy in some (either rural or urban) centres and for the abandonment of others. Some case studies dated between the 5th and the mid-8th century CE (Benito et al., 2015; Cremonini et al., 2013; Sadori et al., 2016) provide a picture of a generally cold and wetter/humid climate. The sites show the advancement of the forest (Cheyette, 2008, pp. 163–164), with broad-leaved trees (in prevalence deciduous, of the Quercus sp.). At S. Michele di Trino (Caramiello et al., 1999), however, pollens related to forest coverage slightly decrease, although still in elevated proportions (43%). The woodland encroachment is consistent with the farming collapse following the Greco-Goth war (535-554 CE) described by Neil Christie (Christie, 2006, pp. 487–491). Despite the continuity of use of wheats of the Triticum/Avena group, the sites show a general spread of grains, as barley (Hordeum vulgare) and rye (Secale cereale), that are more resistant to cold weather and rain. Pollens from Modena, in the Po valley, show a picture of a sparse forest (49,4%), with many wet land plants (28%) and a marked reduction of man’s activity (Bosi et al., 2019; Bosi et al., 2011). In the mountain site of Sant’Antonino di Perti, pasture grass pollens are prevalent, in relation to pastoralism (Arobba and Murialdo, 2001).\nThe third climatic anomaly of the first millennium, known as the “Medieval Warm Period”, occurred after the late antique cooling phase, characterized by increased temperatures. This warming phenomenon reached its peak in the 11th century CE, with temperatures rising approximately 1.5-2°C above the average. The “Medieval Warm Period” spanned from around ∼900 to 1350 CE (Diaz et al., 2011; Graham et al., 2011), lasting for about five centuries in some regions of the northern Hemisphere (Devroey, 2001; Nanni, 2017). The period featured generally mild weather, although some variability was observed. Tree-ring-based temperature reconstructions in North-eastern Italy confirmed warm summers during the 10th and 11th centuries, followed by cooler temperatures in the 12th century (Serre-Bachet, 1994). Furthermore, evidence from Greenland ice cores demonstrate glaciers retreat in the same period in Europe and other parts of the world (Grove and Switsur, 1994). In addition, a reconstruction of the past North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), which favours the flow of warm air, has shown positive values in the Middle age, with a peak in the 1050 CE (Trouet et al., 2009). The concept of a “Medieval Warm Period” or “Medieval Climatic Optimum” has been challenged in recent years, with some scholars referring to this period as a climatic “anomaly”8 (Xoplaki et al., 2016).\n\n\n\nDiachronic comparison of several terrestrial environmental proxies of central-eastern Mediterranean. After Sadori et al. (2016, p. 180).\n\n\nFollowing the increase in temperatures, it was possible to grow common Mediterranean plants at higher temperatures and in northern areas. For instance, grape seeds have been found in England and fig trees were grown in northern Italy (Mann, 2002, p. 515). Pollen analyses confirm a positive trend in agricultural production in the 10th and 11th century CE, leading to landscape changes. In Nogara (Marchesini et al., 2011), the Quercus forest was replaced by fields of cereals (3.2-16.1%), hemp, and grape vine, with high percentages of pasture grass (14-33.9%). In S. Michele di Trino, the woodland coverage reached a minimum of 15%, mostly consisting of Tilia, Ostrya, and Fraxinus, while wetland plants increased, likely in relation to changes in the Po river course. At the site of Sant’Agata Bolognese (Gelichi et al., 2014), there was a reduced presence of conifers (3%) and an introduction of Mediterranean trees like Quercus ilex. The pollen analysis revealed an increase in anthropic plants up to 27%, and besides cereals (18%), fruits, and nuts were cultivated. In Parma (Bosi et al., 2012), the pollen sediments from a cesspit showed a rich variety of cereals and legumes, including the Triticum/Avena group, the Hordeum group, rye, broomcorn millet, and broad bean. In each site, humans are the main driving force of landscape change."

    "section": "2.3 Research framework: Statistics in Archaeology",
    "text": "2.3 Research framework: Statistics in Archaeology\nThe majority of ancient economy studies employ qualitative rather than quantitative methodologies, especially for the Classical period (Mattingly and Salmon, 2001). Some quantitative approaches were discussed in previous sections (Section 2.1), whereas this section will focus on the evolution of statistics as a discipline in archaeology. In archaeology, statistics has been applied since the mid-60s, when the spread of computers and statistical packages made quantitative methods more easily applicable. The growing popularity of computational archaeology in this period also owes a great debt to the “New Archaeology” movement (or “Processual” archaeology). New Archaeology emphasized the application of rigorous scientific analysis at the expense of the cultural historical approach which focused on artefacts cataloguing based on ethnic grouping (Binford and Binford, 1968). David Clarke (1973) described the use of new methods as “the loss of disciplinary innocence”, a statement that had a huge impact on the discipline, especially in Britain (Malone and Stoddart, 1998). Not only archaeology was becoming more analytical, but the development of a theoretical debate also fostered self-consciousness and self-reflection within the discipline (Clarke, 1978). Processual archaeology had little impact in Italy. Alessandro Guidi (1998) recounts the brief phase of ‘processual’ archaeology in Italy in the late 1970s and early 1980s, highlighting the gap in Italian academia between sciences and humanities on the one hand, and the 1960s spike in interest in Marxist archaeology on the other. At a national and international level, analytical archaeology stimulated particular interest in prehistory and settlement patterns, while the study of the Classical and Post-Classical periods was still largely based on historical sources. Although the excitement for quantitative methods decreased after the 1970s, we are now in a phase of renewed enthusiasm for computational methods (Cowgill, 2015). Specific textbooks have been devoted in particular to the use of statistics in archaeology, such as “Quantifying Archaeology” by Steven Shennan (1997), “Statistics in Archaeology” by Michael Baxter (2010), “Digging Numbers” by Mike Fletcher and Gary R. Lock (2005), “Statistics for Archaeologists” by Robert D. Drennan (2013), “Quantitative methods in archaeology using R” by David L. Carlson (2017), and others. The number of archaeological databases is increasing, and the popularity of data science is also investing archaeology. In addition to platforms for sharing open data, some journal articles also typically include reproducible code. This increased accessibility to data and computational power has facilitated the adoption of Bayesian statistics, a more flexible and informative alternative to the traditional frequentist framework that still dominates quantitative archaeology research articles. In the frequentist framework, much of the archaeological statistical inference revolves around null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). NHST provides a set of tools based on the concepts of significance, initially introduced by Ronald Fisher (1925), and critical rejections, proposed by Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson (1928). NHST involves formulating a null hypothesis (H0) that represents the absence of an effect or relationship between variables. Researchers then collect and study data to determine whether there is evidence to reject the null hypothesis. The intent in NHST is to calculate the probability of obtaining the observed (or more extreme) data assuming the null hypothesis is true. This probability is known as the p-value. If p is less than a preset significance level (often 0.05), the null hypothesis can be rejected, and it is possible to conclude that the observed findings are not random (Christensen, 2005; Pernet, 2016). In many statistical tests within the frequentist framework, researchers assess whether two or more samples belong to the same population or differ, using p-values to interpret the significance of their findings. However, one key issue with p-values lies in their interpretation. Often, researchers focus only on the statistical significance of the p-value, without considering the strength of the effect being tested or the sample size. This can lead to misinterpretations and overreliance on significance levels. p-values alone do not provide a complete picture of the analysis. Large sample sizes may lead to small p-values, even for relatively small effects, while small sample sizes may result in small p-values only if they significantly deviate from the null hypothesis. To this end, it can be useful to calculate confidence intervals, which are density curves that provide informative boundaries on the probability that our estimated parameter lies within the population. In statistical analysis, confidence intervals represent the range of values that we believe the true value of the population parameter lies within, with a certain level of confidence. Commonly, the range is set to 95%, which corresponds to a 5% p-value. By using a 95% confidence interval, we can be reasonably confident that the true value of the parameter falls within that interval 95% of the time. These intervals are calculated based on the data collected from the sample and are used to make inferences about the larger population (Cowgill, 2015). The NHST framework has been questioned by several authors (Gelman, 2018; Gill, 1999; Wagenmakers, 2007). Jacob Cohen (1994), in an article provocatively titled “The earth is round (p &lt; .05)” stated:\n\nWhat’s wrong with NHST? Well, among many other things, it does not tell us what we want to know, and we so much want to know what we want to know that, out of desperation, we nevertheless believe that it does! What we want to know is “Given these data, what is the probability that H0 is true?” But as most of us know, what it tells us is “Given that H0 is true, what is the probability of these (or more extreme) data?”\n\nIn this statement, the notation P(D|H0) encapsulates the essence of null hypothesis significance testing (NHST), where we calculate the probability (P) of the observed data (D) given (|) the assumption that the null hypothesis (H0) is true. However, what we truly seek in our research is the inverse probability, P(H|D), which represents the probability of the hypothesis (H) being true, given (|) the observed data (D). This shift from P(D|H) to P(H|D) forms the core principle underlying Bayesian inference. In Bayesian statistics, we embrace this inverse approach to statistical inference, focusing on estimating the probability of different hypotheses being true based on the available evidence (the observed data). Rather than relying solely on significance tests and p-values, Bayesian analysis allows us to update our beliefs about the hypotheses as new data is obtained. This dynamic process, known as Bayesian updating, enables researchers to incorporate prior knowledge and adjust their conclusions accordingly. The Bayesian framework encourages the incorporation of prior probabilities, representing our beliefs about hypotheses before examining the data. As new evidence arises, the posterior probabilities are updated, reflecting our revised beliefs about the hypotheses based on the combined information. While a more technical introduction to Bayesian modelling is provided later on in this thesis, this section will discuss its uses in archaeology so far. The initial applications of Bayesian statistics in archaeology were for radiocarbon date calibration and chronological modelling (Bayliss, 2009; Buck et al., 1992, 1991; Cowgill, 2015). The incorporation of Bayesian approaches, particularly in the former, is now so prevalent that dedicated software, the most well-known of which is OxCal (Ramsey, 1995; Ramsey and Lee, 2013), has been developed. However, Bayesian applications are only recently becoming increasingly common in other domains of archaeology. Erik Otárola-Castillo et al. (2023) provide an adequate overview of archaeological research within a Bayesian framework, as well as a list of some of the most recent uses. Bayesian modelling has been used in bioarchaeology for age-at-death estimations (Hoppa and Vaupel, 2002), reconstruction of ancient diets (Fernandes et al., 2015; Fu et al., 2013), analysis of faunal bone surface modifications (Otárola-Castillo et al., 2018), animal domestication (Larson et al., 2007), and many other researches. There are trade-offs in the choice of a Bayesian framework that may hinder its dissemination among archaeologists and social scientists. Firstly, Bayesian modelling requires a more explicit formulation of the causal inferences under investigation, as we will see in the methodology chapter of this research. Secondly, as Bayesian inference is often based on random sampling methods (i.e. MCMC), it is mathematically and computationally intensive. In this research, the core of the quantification is done in a Bayesian framework, although some analyses, described in more detail in the methods section, are based on a frequentist approach. This choice was made for two reasons: to simplify the calculation and presentation of the results, and to enable the results to be comparable with the two frameworks."

    "text": "2.4 Conclusions\nThis review has outlined the positions and proxies of some key researchers in the study of the first millennium CE in the Italian peninsula. This review has considered the role of settlement size and pattern, ceramics, and historical sources in scholarly understandings of rural exploitation and surplus management. However, we argue (and are supported in this position) that the addition of different proxies to the research can shed new light on old debates of continuity vs. rupture. While is true that archaeobotanical and zooarchaeological analyses are being conducted in Italy and syntheses are being produced, this field is still in an early stage and the full potential of integrating these sources remains unexplored. Quantitative archaeology, with a particular focus on Bayesian inference, offers a promising way to address these challenges. In the following chapters, the bioarchaeological data used in this research will be discussed in detail, providing an overview of the sampling methods, preservation and distribution of remains in the region under study.\n\n\n\n\nAndreolli, B., 1981.

    "section": "3.1 Macroremains",
    "text": "3.1 Macroremains\nMacroremains such as seeds, nutshells, fruit pips, and charcoal (wood preserved after carbonisation) are visible to the naked eye (&gt; 0.25 mm). It is possible to recover macrofossils—in situ, by screening using sieves, and by flotation. In situ collection is possibly the most problematic, as it relies on the experience of the excavator and favours larger finds. In addition, light conditions and the colour of the soil might influence the ability to visualise seeds and charcoal remains. A solution to this problem is to use screening techniques, and choosing an appropriate mesh size can limit the bias for underrepresented taxa (e.g. particularly small seeds). Often, sieves of different mesh sizes are used at the same time for the purpose of eliminating as much soil as possible from the soil sample. In addition to dry screening, archaeologists also use wet screening. Wet screening refers to the practice of pouring water onto the sieve. It differs from wet sieving, which requires the submersion of seeds in a bucket with water that is gently agitated. In any case, adding water to the sieve can be counter-productive, as wetting might destroy the seeds if they are charred (White and Shelton, 2014). One of the most common types of recovery is by flotation, which encompasses several techniques, each based on the principle that water is denser than charred material. Flotation can be either manual or machine-assisted. The former refers to wet sieving, where seeds are submerged in water and the ones that float are recovered using a mesh. Tools and machines have been also developed for flotation, including the hand-pump (which does not require electricity) and other machine-assisted tools (see Figure 3.1) that use water pressure and aeration to separate the seeds from soil. Flotation also allows the recovery of other small-sized archaeological material, including fish and bird bones, and mollusca (Jarman et al., 1972; Turney et al., 2005, p. 125; Williams, 1973). After separating the seeds from the soil, seeds can be identified and quantified. For the identification, researchers use fossil reference collections and photographs (Turney et al., 2005).\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Example of a flotation machine. In the image, the so-called ‘Siraf’ type flotation machine, used at Pantanello (Basilicata). Image after Costantini and Costantini Biasini (2018, p. 373).\n\n\n\n3.1.1 Sampling\nA sample is a smaller subset of elements from a population. In statistics, a population is the entire set of elements which we can draw inferences from. Often, it is not possible to know how large is the population, which is then called universe. Whether consciously or not, archaeology has always dealt with sampling. Much of the archaeological record has been lost or destroyed in time, and what we are able to study is a smaller portion of what once was present (Drennan, 2010, p. 80). If we consider the entire statistical population what is currently available to the archaeologist, it would be possible to sample for instance each bucket of soil excavated and count the total number of seeds found. This will certainly provide the most accurate information, although it is almost never possible in real life situations. Common constraints are time, funding, number of excavators, etc. It is then up to the archaeologist to decide how to collect samples, which will be biased by definition since they will not reflect reality. Why bother with sampling then? Archaeobotanical macroremains can be smaller than 1 mm and sampling can provide more information than collecting seeds with the naked eye (i.e. no sampling) (Orton, 2000, p. 148). Moreover, an effective and robust sampling strategy can limit bias as far as possible and try to return meaningful samples. Depending on the context, resources and individual decisions, several possibilities are available—interval sampling, probabilistic sampling, judgemental sampling, total sampling, or no sampling at all (Jones, 1991). The first, interval (or systematic) sampling, consists in sampling at regular intervals. The intervals can be defined in space (samples evenly spaced out in a grid), in time (sampling every tot. minutes or every \\(n\\)-th bucket), or in the laboratory using a riffle box (a machine designed to divide samples). One drawback of this method is that the regularity in sampling might correspond to a regular pattern in the data, which may bias the results. Probabilistic sampling is a method often advocated for, but rarely used. This type of sample has the advantage of allowing the researcher to draw statistical inferences on the data collected, for instance to calculate the margin of error and confidence intervals. The simplest form of probabilistic sampling is random sampling, for example randomly choosing to sample a square from a grid or a bucket from a series of buckets. Another approach to random sampling is cluster sampling, which requires a prior division of the sampling population into clusters (e.g. by context, area, etc.) and then randomly select some of these clusters during excavation (Orton, 2000). One of the problems that may arise from random and cluster sampling approaches is that of spatial autocorrelation. As Waldo Tobler (1970) puts it:\n\n“The first law of geography: Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.”\n\nOther forms of sampling include judgemental sampling, a feature based approach and total (or blanket) sampling which consists in taking a certain amount of soil from each excavated context. Both methods will be discussed more in detail below. Finally, an excavation can have no sampling at all. Most of the archaeobotanical samples with macroremains recorded in the database were collected using different types of visual sampling, not always made explicit by the authors. Visual sampling occurs when archaeologists can visually see or expect (i.e. judgemental sampling) macroremains in the feature they are excavating. Common features from which samples are usually collected include—pits, hearths, filled anforae, etc. But “how can one argue that the contents of a pit reflect activities involving food specific to that context, if one has not examined samples from floor deposits into which the pit was dug, or the deposits overlying it?” (Pearsall, 2015, p. 75). Lennstrom and Hastorf (1995) lament “feature biases” in many archaeological excavations, as paleobotanists are often called after archaeologists have already recovered materials from specific site features. The authors call for a general misconception in the goal of archaeobotany—to collect as many macroremains as possible. This strategy is, in fact, not very informative about the relationships between plant remains and stratigraphic units, and the general deposition patterns in the site. For instance, Jones et al. (1986) were able to reconstruct the functions of structures and the methods of crop storage at Assiros, northern Greece, through a thorough extensive sampling. Pearsall (2015, p. 74) recommends a “blanket sampling” strategy, which consists in collecting samples for flotation from each stratigraphical unit. The advantages of blanket sampling are manifold:\n\nIf in theory sampling from strategical features (e.g. hearths) maximizes the chances of recovering more macrobotanical remains, in practice this is not always the case. For instance, if a hearth was used on a regular basis, it could possibly have been cleaned of ashes frequently, and the excavator might have more luck sampling around it.\nIncluding the collection of samples from each layer in the excavation leads an uniform and standardised procedure, reducing the variation across samples.\nBlanket sampling allows an easier reconstruction of deposition patterns and of stratigraphic units relations as stated above. For instance, one can analyse differences in macroremains densities across samples.\n\nIn addition to choosing the most efficient sampling strategy, sample size is also a problem that has been discussed in archaeobotany. The sample size, often indicated in litres in archaeological reports, can be constant or variable depending on the context. The size can have important repercussions on the richness of the sample, a topic that will be dealt with more extensively in the chapter discussing the methods used in this thesis. In short, a particularly small sample size can affect the number of species found. In particular, rare species may be either not represented or under-represented (Pearsall, 2015, p. 160). While archaeobotanists have advocated for more specific sampling strategies for over 40 years, very few of the Italian excavations in this dataset applied blanket or probabilistic sampling, and collecting samples from features is still the most common practice.\n\n\n3.1.2 Preservation\nThere are several ways in which seeds can be preserved, among them charring (or carbonisation), mineralisation, waterlogging, desiccation, metal oxide preservation and as imprints in ceramics (Fuller and Lucas, 2014). This section will focus only on grain preservation, excluding wood remains, as anthracological data (charred wood) has not been recorded on the database. The mode of preservation has a strong effect on the species of plants that can be found in the archaeological level. Cereals and nuts have higher chances of being preserved by charring, while fruit pips, herbs and spices are most common in waterlogged sediments. Nuts, fibrous and oil-rich plants are also equally preserved under water. Desiccation greatly preserves several parts of a plant, although it occurs very rarely (Veen, 2018, p. 71). These factors influence the representation of plants in the archaeological context, and one must be aware that the most identified taxa may represent the plants that had the best chance of being preserved. The most represented taxa therefore do not necessarily coincide with the most numerous or used plants at the site being investigated (Pearsall, 2015, p. 42). Figure 3.2 and Figure 3.3 show how different preservation methods affect the representation of a taxon.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Preservation mode of species with more than five occurrences in northwestern Europe in the Roman period [c= charred, m = mineralised, w = waterlogged, u = unknown]. Image after Livarda (2018).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Preservation mode of three plant groups in medieval Britain [black = charred, white = waterlogged, grey = mineralised]. Image after Veen et al. (2013).\n\n\nA final comment must be made on the state of preservation of botanical macrofossils. Regardless of how the seeds have been preserved from deposition to the time of excavation, the state of preservation of individual seeds may also be affected by mechanical actions such as fragmentation or erosion. Indeed, it is not uncommon for an archaeologist to find seeds that are only partially intact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Fragmentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Erosion\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Several stages of fragmentation and erosion of seeds of Sparganium erectum. Image after Jones et al. (2007, p. 79).\n\n\n\n3.1.2.1 Charring\nCarbonisation is the most common way of finding seeds when excavating an archaeological site, most notably when using flotation on the samples. Carbonisation occurs when seeds (or other botanical materials) are exposed to fire at not excessively high temperatures and under anaerobic conditions so that the combustion process is not completed. Other factors include the proximity to the fire source, fuel type and elements associated to the seed (i.e. chaff and straw) (Turney et al., 2014, p. 93). Several experiments have been carried out to understand the way in which carbonisation takes place and for a review of the literature on this topic, readers can refer to Pearsall (2015, pp. 41–42). Charred seeds lose their original colour (turning black), but mostly retain their morphology although slightly changing their dimension. The chance of preservation is particularly high considering that charred material is not attacked by bacteria or fungi (Weiss and Kislev, 2007).\n\n\n3.1.2.2 Mineralisation\nMineralisation is a natural process that leads to the replacement of organic material with inorganic material. Through phosphatisation, soft tissue is replaced by calcium-phosphate minerals that preserve the morphology of the seed (Murphy, 2014). Mineralisation can also occur because some plants are particularly mineral-rich, and the phenomenon takes place prior to deposition. This is known as biomineralisation (Messager et al., 2010). For instance, mineralised seeds can be found in latrines or cesspits (Veen et al., 2013, p. 164).\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: Examples of charred and mineralised seeds from Herculaneum. Image after Rowan (2017).\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2.3 Waterlogging\nOrganic material maintained in a wet environment under very low oxygen levels (anaerobic conditions) can be preserved as the activity of micro-organism is low or entirely absent. Examples of wet environments include natural ones (lake, riverine, marine sediments, marshes, bogs, etc.) or man-made (pits, latrines, wells, ditches, etc.) (Spriggs, 2014). Waterlogged seeds do not degrade markedly, but their starch, sugar and protein content is low and their colour is dark (Weiss and Kislev, 2007).\n\n\n3.1.2.4 Desiccation\nThis phenomenon is limited to very arid regions (mostly Egypt, some areas of China and Spain), where the complete desiccation of the organic material prevents microbial decay. Where plant material is preserved through drying, the preservation is remarkable; for instance, even aDNA survives in desiccated seeds (Veen, 2018, p. 58).\n\n\n3.1.2.5 Metal oxidation\nPlant material can be preserved if found in proximity to metals. Metal oxides when the soil is moist, creating a toxic environment for microbial activity.\n\n\n3.1.2.6 Ceramic imprints\nThe imprints of seeds and plants on the wet clay can help the investigator recognise the morphology of the seed and identify the plant, however the organic material is not preserved and the marks on the pottery are the only visible remains (Schepers and Vries, 2022).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Cereal chaff and straw in a fired clay fragment from Pantanello (Basilicata).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Two-row barley triplet against a fresh triplet from reference collection.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: Examples of ceramic imprints.

Common features from which samples are collected include pits, hearths, and filled anforae. The pitfalls of this type of sampling have already been outlined in this chapter. In addition to differences in sampling strategies, recovery techniques also differed between reports, which can lead to some taxa being underrepresented. It was not possible to quantify how many sites used flotation or dry sieving, as this information was lacking, especially from older reports. On the other hand, the mode of preservation has been indicated in most cases, with charring being the most common. The list of samples that included the preservation mode in their reports is listed in Table 3.2.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.2: Preservation mode of the archaeobotanical samples in the database.

Specifically, there is a higher representation of samples from northern Italy, indicating a greater focus on archaeological investigations in that region. Conversely, certain areas in the south of Italy show a relatively lower representation of archaeobotanical sampling. Additionally, there is a notable lack of archaeobotanical data from central Italy during the investigated period. These spatial discrepancies in the distribution of archaeobotanical samples suggest varying degrees of research emphasis and archaeological investigations across different regions of Italy. The abundance of samples from northern Italy may be attributed to a combination of factors, such as research interests and more specific factors influencing the preservation and recovery of plant remains in that region. In contrast, the lower representation of archaeobotanical sampling in specific areas of the south and center might indicate a relative scarcity of archaeobotanical investigations or limited attention paid to the study of plant remains in those regions during the studied period. These observations are based on the available archaeobotanical samples and may be influenced by various factors affecting archaeological investigations in different regions. The geographical variability in the number of available samples also concerns the different topographic features, including coasts, plains, hills, and mountains. The topographical distribution of samples can be visually explored in Figure 3.8 and Table 3.3, which indicate that most samples are located at low elevations, either on plains or coasts. This suggests that archaeological investigations and archaeobotanical sampling have primarily focused on these areas. However, a more detailed examination of the relationship between altitude and plant occurrence is provided in the results chapter, where altitude is modeled against the presence of plants.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.3: Topographical distribution of archaeobotanical samples.\n\n\nTopography\nSamples\n\n\n\n\nCoast\n54\n\n\nHill\n26\n\n\nMountain\n26\n\n\nPlain\n71\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.8: Topographical distribution of the archaeobotanical samples."

    "section": "3.3 Notes on nomenclature",
    "text": "3.3 Notes on nomenclature\nThe botanical species names used in this research adhere to the conventional nomenclature provided by Zohary et al. (2012). In the dataset, the species that were considered were the most common among all excavations, so that plants could be comparable.\n\n3.3.1 Cereals\nArguably, the most commonly discovered grains in Italian archaeological excavations are free-threshing wheats (Triticum aestivum/durum). They are listed as a single column because distinguishing between hard wheat and bread wheat is challenging without the rachis (Roushannafas et al., 2023). Although notably an important cereal, Triticum spelta has not been included as it was only sporadically recorded. Whenever it was present, it was categorised under the Cerealia und. column, which also comprises other grains belonging to the Triticum group that could not be identified further by the authors. Occurrences of Avena sp. have been recorded whenever found in excavation reports, including the counts of cultivated oats (Avena sativa). This species is challenging to identify as caryopses alone are insufficient, and it is prevalent in Italy as a weed that grows alongside cereal fields. Consequently, although Avena sp. is in the database, limited inferences can be drawn regarding this taxon.\n\n\n3.3.2 Legumes\nSimilar to cereals, the Leguminosae column contains pulses that authors were unable to assign to a species. The Vicia genus is a sizable family of Fabaceae, and some of its members are cultivated. The database lists Vicia faba and Vicia sativa as separate columns due to their frequent occurrence in excavations. Other Vicia types that could not be identified or were only occasionally identified (such as Vicia ervilia) were listed under the Vicia sp. column. The column Lathyrus cicera/sativus (grass pea) contains two species that are difficult to identify below genus level and whose previous identifications have proved unreliable (Tarongi et al., 2023).\n\n\n3.3.3 Fruits and nuts\nA wide variety of fruit species were recorded in the dataset. As with other plants, some counts have been reported in a single column because they were more difficult to identify below genus level, or because they were very sporadic and in danger of being under-represented in the overall quantifications. This is the case, for example, of Prunus sp. The dataset reports separate column for five Prunus species: P. persica (peach), P. domestica (plum), P. cerasus (sour cherry), P. avium (wild cherry), and P. spinosa (blackthorn). Other species that were rare or nuts that could be attributed to a Prunus species were reported in the column Prunus sp. It was not possible in this research to model the occurrence of each fruit species, and models were built for macrocategories as ‘Nuts’, ‘Common domestic fruits’, and ‘Less common fruits’.

    "text": "4.1 Sampling\nAlthough faunal remains are generally more abundant and easily identifiable compared to botanical remains, the number of recovered remains at a given archaeological site is inevitably influenced by the chosen sampling strategy. As emphasized by Terry O’Connor (2000, pp. 28–30), it is crucial to establish a sampling strategy prior to commencing excavation. The author outlines three potential strategies that can be employed in the field:\n\nAll-from-all: This strategy involves collecting all bone fragments encountered in every context or deposit within the excavation area. It aims to capture a comprehensive representation of the faunal assemblage without selective biases.\nSome-from-all: In this strategy, a selective approach is taken, and only a portion of the bone fragments from each context or deposit is collected. The selection may be based on specific criteria, such as bone size, element type, or preservation quality. This strategy allows for a more manageable sample size while still providing valuable faunal data.\nSome-from-some: This strategy combines elements of the previous two approaches. It involves selecting certain contexts or deposits for comprehensive sampling (similar to the all-from-all strategy) while applying a selective approach in other areas (similar to the some-from-all strategy). This strategy allows for a balance between comprehensive coverage and practical constraints.\n\nAs highlighted in the previous chapter, various drawbacks of different sampling strategies have been discussed, including the limitations of blanket, judgemental (or feature-based), and random approaches. These strategies are influenced by factors such as research questions, time constraints, and economic considerations. The blanket approach, which involves collecting all the bone fragments from every context without any selective criteria, may lead to an overwhelming amount of material to analyse. This can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, especially when dealing with large or complex archaeological sites. The judgemental or feature-based approach relies on selecting specific contexts or features for sampling based on prior knowledge or assumptions about their potential significance. While this approach may provide focused data collection, there is a risk of bias and overlooking important information from other contexts or areas of the site. The random approach involves selecting samples in a random or systematic manner to ensure unbiased representation. However, this approach may not effectively capture the full range of variability within the site and may result in missing important data. As the sampling effort increases, the probability of encountering rare species also tends to rise. By collecting a larger quantity of bone fragments or applying a more comprehensive sampling approach, researchers increase their chances of capturing a broader range of faunal remains, including those that may be less common or uncommonly preserved (Reitz and Wing, 2008, p. 110). Ultimately, the choice of a sampling strategy depends on the specific research questions, available resources, and logistical constraints of the excavation project. By considering these factors, researchers can determine the most appropriate approach to ensure the collection of meaningful and representative faunal data within the given constraints."

    "text": "4.2 Preservation\nThere are several taphonomic processes that influence the preservation of faunal remains in archaeological contexts. While providing an exhaustive list is beyond the scope of this dissertation, a synthesis presented by O’Connor (2000) offers valuable insights into these processes:\n\nBiotic processes encompass the pre-death factors that influence the composition of the animal population in a specific time and space. These processes include ecological interactions, competition, predation, and disease dynamics among living organisms.\nThanatic processes refer to the events that lead to the death and subsequent deposition of the animal remains. They can be natural, such as natural mortality or predator-prey interactions, or human-induced, including hunting, butchery, and discard practices. Other animals, such as scavengers, can also contribute to the deposition of faunal remains.\nPerthotaxic processes involve the movement and destruction of bones before their incorporation into a deposit. This includes various agents such as fluvial action (river currents), scavenging by animals, and human waste management practices that can alter the distribution and integrity of skeletal elements.\nTaphic processes encompass the chemical and physical agents that act upon the bones after burial. These processes can either contribute to the preservation or degradation of bones. Factors such as soil chemistry, burial environment, and exposure to moisture, acidity, or other corrosive agents play a role in bone preservation.\nAnataxic processes represent recycling processes in which buried bones are re-exposed to external agents such as fluvial action, sub-aerial weathering, trampling, or other attritional processes. These processes can accelerate, redirect, or even halt the physical and chemical changes initiated by taphic processes.\n\nUnderstanding these taphonomic processes is essential for interpreting faunal remains in archaeological contexts. They provide insights into the complex journey of animal bones from their formation to their recovery and subsequent analysis, shedding light on the potential biases and alterations that may affect the assemblage."

    "section": "4.3 Counting bones",
    "text": "4.3 Counting bones\nWhen examining zooarchaeological remains, various methods can be employed to assess the abundance of a specific species at an archaeological site. Two commonly used measures for quantifying abundance are NISP (Number of Identified Specimens) and MNI (Minimum Number of Individuals). Both of them are not without shortcomings, which will be listed below.\n\n4.3.1 Number of Identified Specimens (NISP)\nThe Number of Identified Specimens (NISP) is the measure provided by most reports and is commonly used to estimate the relative frequency of zooarchaeological assemblages. It provides a count of the number of bone fragments identified to bone type and taxon (Lambacher et al., 2016; Orton, 2010). Although being so widely used, NISP is not without its limitations. One key challenge is its sensitivity to bone fragmentation, as it counts every encountered bone fragment, assigning equal weight to each fragment. However, animal bones exhibit distinct patterns of fragmentation, resulting in variations in fragment counts across species. Furthermore, different animals possess diverse types of hard tissue, leading to variations in the ease of identification for different bone elements (Klein and Cruz-Uribe, 1984; Reitz and Wing, 2008). Moreover, the preservation modes of remains play a significant role in the representation of species within the assemblage. Certain species may be better preserved than others due to factors such as differential decay rates or taphonomic biases. Additionally, consumption patterns and butchery practices can influence the preservation of specific bones. For instance, if an animal was butchered outside the settlement and only selected meat portions were brought in, certain bones may be underrepresented in the assemblage (Kent, 1993). Excavation methods, such as sieving and flotation, can introduce biases by selectively recovering smaller and more fragile remains like fish vertebrae, mollusc shells, or small mammal bones. Consequently, the application (or lack thereof) of sieving and flotation can introduce biases in the composition of the assemblage. In addition to these challenges, another issue that can inflate NISP counts is the inclusion of an entire skeleton of an animal. This can skew the relative frequency estimates, as a single individual contributes a disproportionate number of bones to the assemblage. To address this concern, another measure called the Minimum Number of Individuals (MNI) is often used (O’Connor, 2000, p. 56). Considering these factors, the NISP measure should be interpreted with caution, taking into account the complexities associated with bone fragmentation, preservation biases, consumption practices, and excavation methods.\n\n\n4.3.2 Minimum Number of Individuals (MNI)\nIntroduced by Theodore White (1953), the Minimum Number of Individuals (MNI) is a measure that estimates the minimum number of individuals needed to account for all the skeletal elements of a particular species found at a site. MNI takes into account the duplication of skeletal elements within a species, providing a more refined assessment of the faunal assemblage. Analysts determine MNI by examining the bones recovered and identifying the minimum number of individuals required to account for each bone element, considering factors such as articulation, overlap, and symmetry. Despite its utility, MNI has faced criticism from archaeologists, leading to the development of alternative approaches for its refinement. Sándor Bökönyi (1971, 1970) and Raymond Chaplin (1971) proposed incorporating additional factors like age, sex, and size to improve the accuracy of MNI calculations. In contrast, Donald Grayson (1981; Grayson and Dimbleby, 2014) highlighted the close relationship between MNI and NISP, emphasizing also how sample size affect the MNI estimation. A recognized limitation of MNI is its potential to overestimate the presence of rare taxa within an assemblage. This occurs because a single specimen of a rare taxon is given the same weight (i.e., a count of one) as multiple bones from a more common taxon (O’Connor, 2000, p. 60). Furthermore, Cornelis and Ina Plug and Plug (1990) cautioned against using MNI for further numerical analysis, including its conversion to relative frequencies, due to the mathematical incoherence of proportions derived from minimum values. While MNI has been subject to ongoing debate and critique among zooarchaeologists, with some stating that ‘critiquing MNI might be considered a growth industry among zooarchaeologists’ (Reitz and Wing, 2008, p. 206), this research primarily relies on NISP as the primary data measure. NISP is commonly reported in zooarchaeological studies, and its estimation methods tend to be less variable compared to MNI. While acknowledging the ongoing discussions surrounding MNI, this research opts to utilize NISP due to its widespread availability and more consistent application in reporting zooarchaeological data."

Please select the desired chronology (or chronologies) from the legend on the right. Legend: R = Roman, LR = Late Roman, EMA = Early Middle Ages, Ma = 11th c. onwards\n\n\n\nThe zooarchaeological data available for this project consists in 465 samples with faunal remains collected from a total of 228 sites dated between the 1st century BCE to the 11th century CE (Figure 4.2). The geographical and chronological distribution of the samples varies greatly, with some areas or chronological phases that are better represented in the database. The number of samples for each phase is detailed in Table 4.1, with samples that span more chronologies repeated. As explained in the methods section, some samples were dated between two chronologies, and the entry had to be repeated twice. Table 4.2 reports the total NISP count of the samples in the database, with and without the repetition. Table 4.3 shows instead the NISP count of samples divided by chronology. The group sizes in the dataset do not present significant class imbalance issues, particularly for the Roman, Late Roman, and Early Medieval phases. However, the 11th century phase has the smallest group size. This smaller size can be attributed to the fact that it represents the upper boundary of the research period under investigation. From what concerns spatial dispersion, there is no discernible geographical pattern in the distribution of zooarchaeological samples, although certain regions lack a substantial amount of data. Notably, central Italian regions such as Umbria and Marche are among those with limited representation in the dataset. In contrast, there is a concentration of samples specifically related to the Roman and Late Roman chronologies in the city of Rome and Ostia. The uneven distribution of samples in different regions and the concentrated presence of samples in Rome and Ostia are addressed separately in the results section. This section includes an analysis of the effect of Rome on the urban statistical models, examining how the abundance of samples from these locations may impact the overall findings and interpretations.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.1: Number of zooarchaeological samples distributed by phase.

The distribution of samples demonstrates that plains and coasts exhibit a higher number of samples, with 181 and 119 samples, respectively. On the other hand, hills (n = 125) and mountains (n = 40) are slightly less represented in comparison. However, in addition to topographical models, the analysis also incorporates models that consider the elevations of the sites. This approach allows for a more detailed examination of the relationship between animals occurrence and site elevations. The results section provides a breakdown of the sites categorized by their elevation, providing further insights into the influence of elevation on the distribution of zooarchaeological remains.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Topographical distribution of the zooarchaeological samples."

Most archaeological excavations are presently working with databases, so that information concerning each stratigraphic unit and finds can be recorded. This also allows databases to be be linked and interact with Geographical Information Systems (GIS), enabling researchers to introduce a spatial component in their investigation.\nIn many cases, this data remains private even after the excavation results have been published, although more and more teams are making their data available to the public. The growing popularity of open data has also created a need for standardisation. Since the 1970s, researchers have been working on thesauri (Figuera, 2018), dictionaries and guides for the correct archiving of archaeological information (e.g. pottery classes, context types, chronologies, etc.). A common system of naming practices is essential for sharing, integrating and analysing data. More recently, standardised databases and repositories are being created and made openly available (Gattiglia, 2015; Kandel et al., 2023; Niccolucci, 2020; Richards, 2021).\nMost of the archaeological databases are based on SQL, as the visual relationships between different data structures are easier to understand."

    "section": "5.2 Creating an Environmental Archaeology database",
    "text": "5.2 Creating an Environmental Archaeology database\nAn integrated database of environmental archaeological data is still absent in Italy. A first step towards the digitisation of botanical data was taken by the BRAIN project (Botanical Records of Archaeobotany Italian Network), a census of the Italian excavations that reported archaeobotanical data (Mercuri et al., 2015). Although the website does not provide raw data, it was useful for the bibliographical research for this project. For faunal remains, a database is also missing, although a pilot project was started at the University of Siena by Boscato et al. (2007). The database was created using FileMaker Pro and was likely never published. More recently, in the later stages of this research, a database of Italian faunal data from 800 BCE to 800 CE has been published by Schmidtova et al. (2023).\nThe scope of this project therefore required the creation of a database containing raw environmental data. The creation of a database for this research responded to the need for a systematic approach to storing environmental data in a common format and in a way that is convenient for querying, rather than simply archiving the information. The aim is to have data readily available for exploratory data analysis in an automated process that does not require the query to be adapted and the data to be manually wrangled each time a new assemblage is added to the collection. This project uses MariaDB, a fast and stable fork of MySQL.\nThe database was structured with the creation of 21 tables. The table site_list is the core table, from which most of the other tables in the schema depend. The entries in the table are based on the chronology of a single assemblage. The chronology is defined both by the phase1 and by the centuries, with two columns: startcentury and endcentury. If a context has been sampled more than once, there will be as many entries as many chronologies. If a context has been sampled both for seeds and bones, the assemblage IDs will be recorded on the same entry (if the chronologies match).\n\nExample of two assemblages retrieved from the same location.\n\n\nContext\nAssemblage #ID\n\n\n\n\nImola, villa Clelia, 6th c.\n15\n\n\nImola, villa Clelia, 10th-11th c.\n16\n\n\n\nSince the table is context based, each site has been provided with an unique ID, so that if the site has been sampled in different areas the database can be still queried using the site ID2. In addition to the reference to the assemblages table, the table site_list also contains references to child tables with information about: site type, geography, altitude, coordinates, and region. The assemblages are organized in three tables, depending on the type of remain that has to be recorded in the database:\n\nplant_remains\nfaunal_remains\n\nEach entry in the assemblages tables contains information about chronology, sampling type and notes, reference to the publication, reference to the main site, and the raw data. Figure 5.1 shows the schema with the complete list of tables in the database.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Schema of the database, with the table site_list at the core.\n\n\nThe data was stored in the database after a thorough bibliographical research of the excavated sites (with a chronology pertaining to the 1st millennium CE) where environmental analyses have been undertaken. As in most of the cases the material was retrieved from physical publications, not digitised, the process of data entry was manual and could not be automatised. A list of the publication types where data was retrieved from can be visualised in Figure 5.2.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Count of the publication types in the database."

The last name is provided in full, while the first name is only indicated by the first letter. For instance, Jane Doe is formatted as “Doe, J.”.\nyear: numerical field of the type int(11), which provides the year of the publication.\nsite_code: numerical field of the type int(11), which provides the code of the site, from the field site_code in the table site_list.\npublication_type: foreign key, linked to the table bibliography_publ_type (See Table 5.7).\n\n\n\n5.3.1.2.2 Table: bibliography_publ_type\nThe table bibliography_publ_type is linked to the bibliography table and consists of two fields:\n\nuuid: a unique id for the publication type, incremental and auto generated.\nType: text field describing the publication type.\n\n\n\nTable 5.7: The table bibliography_publ_type.

The names of the plants were in fact matching across publications. However, in some cases authors could only identify the seeds’ species (e.g. Avena sp.), or it was not possible to properly identify the taxa (e.g. Cerealia und.). Specific taxa are indeed hard to identify without other elements of the plants; for this reason some taxa have been merged together in one column of the database. For instance, Triticum aestivum and Triticum durum are recorded together. Seed counts have been reported in the species column when an author reported a taxon rarely reported in other publications, rather than creating a new column for that taxon. For instance, Prunus armeniaca is reported in the column Prunus sp. In this case, the name of the identified taxon can be accessed through the extra_notes field. More information on the nomenclature used in this research can be found in the Chapter 3.\n\n5.3.2.1.1 Table: plant_remains\nThe plant remains have been stored in the master table plant_remains. This is the main table that contains the absolute counts for each assemblage and it is linked to other tables, to locate the assemblage at site and chronological level. The fields included in the table are:\n\nuuid: a unique id for the assemblage, incremental and auto generated.\nsite_code: foreign key (linked to the table site_list) referring to the site where the assemblage has been collected. The input value is an integer of the type int(11).\nsite_type: foreign key (linked to the table site_type), referring to the typology of the site where the assemblage has been collected. See Section 5.3.1.1.2 for details of the input values.\ndata_valid_start: an integer indicating the first century covered by the assemblage. The value can be positive for CE centuries and negative for BCE centuries. For instance, if the author attributes the assemblage to the 2nd c. BCE to the 1st c. CE, the field will be filled with the value -2.\ndata_valid_end: an integer indicating the last century covered by the assemblage. The value can be positive for CE centuries and negative for BCE centuries. For instance, if the author attributes the assemblage to the 2nd c. BCE to the 1st c. CE, the field will be filled with the value 1.\nsampling_notes: a text field, of the type longtext, that can be filled with information concerning sampling methodologies, precise location of sampling (e.g. a kiln, a kitchen, a wastepit, etc.), a more precise chronological range (if the author provided a datation in years rather than centuries), preservation mode (e.g. charred, waterlogged, etc.) and further notes that might be useful.\nextra_notes: a multipurpose text field, of the type longtext, that can be filled with information concerning first interpretation of the layer or the data from which the assemblage has been collected. The field also reports if the excavation provided other archaeobotanical material not included in this database (e.g. anthracological analyses), or plants that are not part of this table (e.g. ruderals, weeds, etc.). Finally, the field also contains the breakdown of counts that have been summarised under one column. For instance, the field Cerealia at times summarises cereal types that are not recorded in separate fields; cereals as Triticum compactum are rarely mentioned in Italian archaeobotanical reports, and if reported on a separate field it would be underrepresented.\ndata_usable: boolean field. The value is 0 if the assemblage is not reliable (e.g. data too scarce, chronology too vague, etc.), but was recorded in the database as it might be useful for qualitative studies. If the value is 0 and the assemblage is hence not usable, the reason is reported in the field extra_notes. The value is 1 if the assemblage is reliable and it can be used quantitatively or for presence/absence analysis. Note that if the value is 0 the site will not appear in the map.\noverrepresented_data: a text field, of the type longtext, that can be filled with information regarding overrepresented taxa. This is a common occurrence in contexts as wine/olive processing areas or stocking deposits.\nreference_id: foreign key (linked to the table bibliography), referring to the bibliographical source that contained information about the assemblage. See Section 5.3.1.2 for details of the input values.\nvolume: an integer value reporting the volume (in litres) of the sample Whenever more samples from the same location and with the same chronology have been reported by the author, they have been merged together and the volume represents the total of each sample. The volumes of the individual samples are reported in the field extra_notes.\nsampling_type: foreign key (linked to the table bot_sampling_type), referring to the sampling methodology used by the author. See Table 5.9 for details of the input values.\npres_charred: a binary field which takes the value of 1 if the macroremains in the assemblage are preserved by charring, 0 if the seeds were preserved any other way.\npres_mineralised: a binary field which takes the value of 1 if the macroremains in the assemblage are preserved by mineralisation, 0 if the seeds were preserved any other way.\npres_waterlogged: a binary field which takes the value of 1 if the macroremains in the assemblage are preserved by waterlogging, 0 if the seeds were preserved any other way.\nno_of_samples: an integer indicating the number of samples collected from the context recorded in the entry. As for the volume field, whenever more samples from the same location and with the same chronology have been reported by the author, they have been merged together.\nFields for the absolute counts of the taxa: Triticum aestivum/durum, Triticum dicoccum, Triticum monococcum, Avena sp, Hordeum vulgare, Panicum milliaceum, Secale cereale, Setaria italica, Sorghum bicolor, Cerealia ind, Leguminosae, Lens culinaris, Pisum sativum, Vicia faba, Vicia sativa, Vicia sp, Lathyrus cicera/sativus, Cicer aretinum, Cornus mas, Corylus avellana, Ficus carica, Fragaria vesca, Juglans regia, Castanea sativa, Malus domestica, Olea europaea L, Prunus cerasus, Prunus avium, Prunus sp, Prunus persica, Prunus domestica, Prunus spinosa, Rubus fruticosus, Pyrus communis, Sambucus nigra, Cucumis melo, Vitis vinifera, Linum usatissimus, Sorbus sp. The fields are of the type int(11) and are filled with the absolute count copied from the author’s report.\n\n\n\n5.3.2.1.2 Table: bot_sampling_type\nThe table bot_sampling_type is linked to the plant_remains table and consists of two fields:\n\nsampl_id: a unique id for the sampling typology, incremental and auto generated.\nsampl_type: text field describing the sampling methods. Other sampling types that are commonly used in archaeobotany (e.g. total sampling, probabilistic sampling, etc.) are not part of this table as no excavation reported using them.\n\n\n\nTable 5.9: The table bot_sampling_type and its values.

In most cases, animal names were matching across publications. Whenever this was not the case, the scientific name of the species was provided, which was helpful in case of uncertainties (e.g. ‘Hen’ vs ‘Chicken’). Given the size of this project, not every species has been recorded in the database. Species that were not useful to the reconstruction of agricultural practices (for instance, tortoises) have been recorded in the field extra_notes of the table faunal_remains. Other species were merged together into a single column. This is the case of Mollusca. When authors were not certain about the classification of certain bones to the species level, they have been reported at the genus or family level. The most common occurrence is for sheep and goats, mostly reported under the Caprinae family, or for donkeys and horses, reported under the Equus sp.\n\n5.3.3.1 Table: faunal_remains\nThe animal remains have been recorded in the master table faunal_remains. This is the main table that contains the NISP counts from each assemblage and it is linked to other tables, to locate the assemblage at site and chronological level. The fields included in the table are:\n\nuuid: a unique id for the assemblage, incremental and auto generated.\nsite_code: foreign key (linked to the table site_list) referring to the site where the assemblage has been collected.

For instance, if the author attributes the assemblage to the 2nd c. BCE to the 1st c. CE, the field will be filled with the value 1.\nsampling_notes: a text field, of the type longtext, that can be filled with information concerning sampling methodologies, precise location of sampling (e.g. a kiln, a kitchen, a wastepit, etc.), a more precise chronological range (if the author provided a datation in years rather than centuries), and further notes that might be useful.\nextra_notes: a multipurpose text field, of the type longtext, that can be filled with information concerning first interpretation of the layer or the data from which the assemblage has been collected. The field also reports if the excavation provided other information that are not included in this database, namely—age, sex, MNI counts, etc. Finally, the field also contains the breakdown of counts that have been summarised under one column. For instance, the field Mollusca or ‘Unsp. birds’; some types of birds are rarely mentioned in other publications, and if reported on a separate field they would be underrepresented.\ndata_usable: boolean field. The value is 0 if the assemblage is not reliable (e.g. data too scarce, chronology too vague, etc.), but was recorded in the database as it might be useful for qualitative studies.

The value is No if the publication did not report MNI (minimum number of individuals) counts and Yes if MNI was provided.\ndata_type: foreign key (linked to the table zoo_data_type) used to record which type of data the authors reported in the publication. See Table 5.10 for details of the input values.\ntot_id: an integer (of the type int(11)) that reports the number of identified bones in the assemblage.\ntot_unid: an integer (of the type int(11)) that reports the number of unidentified bones in the assemblage.\nFields for the NISP values of the species, reported with the scientific name: Sus scrofa domesticus, Bos taurus, Ovis aries, Capra hircus, Ovis/Capra, Canis familiaris, Equus caballus, Equus asinus, Equidae, Sus scrofa ferus, Cervus elaphus, Dama Dama L, Capreolus c, Cervidae, Lepus, Ursus actor, Glis Glis, Vulpes vulpes L, Unsp birds, Gallus g, Anser a, Unsp fish, Esox lucius, Salmo trutta, Salvelinus umbla, Tinca Tinca, Mollusca.

    "text": "6.1 Data collection\nThis section focuses on the data collection phase, complementing the data entry process discussed in Chapter 5. The research uses legacy or published archaeobotanical and zooarchaeological data from a variety of sources such as monographs, book chapters, journal articles, conference papers, excavation reports, websites, and dissertations. The sites bibliography (in the Online Supplementary Materials) provides a comprehensive list of these sources, while Figure 5.2 offers a graphical overview of the distribution of primary data sources. A few existing syntheses of archaeobotanical and zooarchaeological data (cf. Chapter 2) significantly contributed to the foundation of the database. The data was then organised and stored in a relational database, as detailed in the previous chapter.\nThe publications selected met a number of criteria. Only trusted academic publications were considered, with a requirement for precise site location information or specific geographical context. Only sources that reported raw counts of plant and animal remains were selected. While data quality varied, efforts were made to include details from older excavation reports, albeit with some limitations. Comprehensive information, including sampling strategies, stratigraphic unit (SU) numbers, preservation methods, and sampled soil volume, were incorporated where available. To ensure robust statistical analysis and meaningful results, certain exclusions were necessary. Sporadic finds and low-quantity assemblages were omitted from particular analyses (e.g., PERMANOVA and nMDS) but retained in the database for comprehensive documentation. For plant and animal taxa, clear and unambiguous taxonomic indications were required for inclusion in the database. For example, plants belonging to the Triticum group that could not be further identified to species level were classified as ‘Unsp. Cereals’. Similarly, animal bones that were either unidentified or identified only by size (e.g. large ungulates) were stored as ‘unidentified’ to avoid potential confusion with other taxa.\nThe samples selected for this research come from sites that fall within the spatial and chronological boundaries of the study. Inclusion criteria encompassed sites within mainland Italy, dating from the 1st century BCE to the 11th century CE. In order to assess the geographical differences within the peninsula, and to simplify the statistics, the region under review was ideally divided into three parts: northern, central, and southern Italy. Northern Italy lies between today’s political northern limit and the latitude of about 43°N, the centre between about 42°N and 41°N, and the south from about 40°N to the southern limit of Calabria. To facilitate this division, the boundary of today’s regions was followed (Table 5.6). Although the region of Abruzzo is currently considered part of southern Italy for cultural reasons, it has been included in central Italy following a geographical logic. There are important micro-ecological differences between regions, but each of these three sub-regions has coastal, plain, hilly and mountainous areas. The choice of boundaries was based on other large-scale studies of ancient Italy (Palmisano et al., 2021; Parkinson et al., 2021).\nChapter 5, outlines site details, including location, geographical features, site type, and culture. Whenever it was not possible to assign a site to a specific culture (e.g. Byzantine, Lombard, etc.), this field was filled in generically with the corresponding chronology. For this project, decisions have been made on how to classify archaeological sites for the purposes of collecting statistical data and storing it in the database. While some sites are relatively easy to identify and categorise, there can be uncertainty, for example, in classifying sites as urban or rural, as these terms can have different meanings in the context of archaeology. The problem of correctly defining a settlement is not new to archaeological theory, and there have been several attempts to define the concept of ‘site’ itself (Bowes, 2020, p. 11; Davis, 2020; Dunnell, 1992; Parsons, 1972; Trigger, 1967). In order to ensure accurate categorisation, it was essential to consider the specific context and characteristics of each site, as well as the definitions and criteria used to classify them. This meticulous approach allowed for a robust selection of sites falling within the spatial and chronological boundaries of the study, thus ensuring the reliability and relevance of the data collected. For example, isolated and smaller settlements that did not have the typical characteristics of the Roman (Gros and Torelli, 2014) or medieval (Heers, 1995; Piccinato, 1993) city (public buildings, etc.) were recorded as ‘rural’. In the majority of cases, the site classification adhered to the original categorization provided by the respective authors.\nAnother criterion for selecting an assemblage was chronology. Each assemblage (or collection of assemblages) had to be associated with a chronological range in centuries or years. Where reports gave only vague chronologies, such as ‘Roman’ or ‘early medieval’, the report was discarded. This approach minimises the risk of misinterpretation when analysing the data. In many cases, publications report chronologies expressed in phases; if these phases were undated, the assemblage was not included in the database. The level of detail for assemblages from the same site included in the database is contextual and chronological. If the same context (e.g. ‘Room A’) provided several assemblages for the same chronological range, these were merged. This choice, although it may result in a loss of scale of detail, was necessary for reasons of time and resources. Most of the statistics performed on the dataset are based on a assemblage periodisation, from the Roman Age to the Medieval Age. The chronologies were defined as follows:\n\n[R] Roman: from the 1st century BCE to the 2nd century CE.\n[LR] Late Roman: from the 3rd to the 5th century CE.\n[EMA] Early Middle Ages: from the 6th to the 10th century CE.\n[Ma] Middle Ages: from the 11th century CE onwards.\n\nIn the database, the tables faunal_chronologies and plants_chronologies connect each bioarchaeological assemblage to another table with the identification numbers for the periods (e.g. Sample 1 = ID 1). If an assemblage has a chronology ranging between two periods, two separate entries will be recorded on the database (e.g. Sample 1 – 2nd to 3rd c. CE = Periods: Roman, Late Roman) with the result of the assemblage being repeated in both periods.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Periodisation schema.\n\n\nOne of the methodological issues affecting this project is that of chronological fuzziness. Dating plant and animal remains using radiocarbon is very rare, at least in the samples recorded in the database. Most of these samples are dated using ceramics, and chronologies can range between one century or several. Rather than creating arbitrary weights that would affect the models in unexpected ways, all assemblages were considered to have the same weight and impact on the calculations. For example, if an assemblage spans three centuries, it is difficult to say whether the layer was formed in three centuries (e.g. a waste pit used over a long period), or whether the dating of that layer is less precise because a particular type of pottery was used over a long period."

    "text": "6.2 Introduction to statistical computing\nStatistical computing, often referred to as computational statistics, is a branch of statistics that uses computational approaches to solving statistical problems. Traditionally, the term ‘statistical computing’ places more emphasis on numerical methods, while ‘computational statistics’ refer to topics such as resampling methods, exploratory data analysis, neural networks, etc. (Rizzo, 2019). Specifically, computational statistics deals with methods “unthinkable before the computer age” (Lauro, 1996). In archaeology, one widely used programming language for statistical computing is R, which has the advantage of relying on its strong academic community. The community actively contributes to the development of new packages, expanding the functionality and versatility of R for statistical computing. Researchers often choose R for statistical computing in archaeology due to its comprehensive statistical capabilities, flexibility, and the ability to reproduce and share analyses. The syntax and structure of R are specifically designed to facilitate data analysis and statistical modelling, allowing researchers to perform complex analyses efficiently. Additionally, R provides powerful data visualisation tools, enabling researchers to create visually appealing and informative graphs to communicate their findings.\n\n6.2.1 Statistical programming: R\nR, as described on the R-Project FAQs is a “system for statistical computation and graphics. It consists of a language plus a run-time environment with graphics, a debugger, access to certain system functions, and the ability to run programs stored in script files”. Increasingly popular for data scientists, R is based on S and provides its own IDE (the R GUI), although RStudio is the most popular IDE for computing the R language. For this project, RStudio was the standard IDE.\n\n6.2.1.1 R Packages\nIn addition to base R, several packages enhance its performances and offer more tools to users. The packages are distributed by the official CRAN repository, which counts more than 20,248 packages1. This section details some of the packages that have been most useful for this research.\n\n6.2.1.1.1 tidyverse\nThe tidyverse ecosystem (Wickham et al., 2019) is a core set of packages for R, maintained by Hadley Wickham for importing, tidying, transforming and visualising data which includes packages such as—ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, stringr, tibble, forcats, purr, readr.\n\n\n6.2.1.1.2 ggplot2\nggplot2 is the most common data visualisation package for R, included in the tidyverse environment. The package substitutes the R base graphics and allows visualisation of single and multiple components (Wickham, 2016).\n\n\n6.2.1.1.3 knitr\nThe knitr engine enables the integration of R with HTML, Markdown and LaTeX. The package allows reproducible research (Xie, 2021) and was used for generating dynamic reports and documentation for this thesis.\n\n\n6.2.1.1.4 vegan\nThe vegan package (Oksanen et al., 2022) is designed for ordination methods, diversity analysis and multivariate analysis in ecology.\n\n\n6.2.1.1.5 rethinking\nThe rethinking package (McElreath, 2023) provides tools and resources for statistical modeling and data analysis in a Bayesian framework. Developed by Richard McElreath, it is specifically designed to support the concepts and techniques described in his book “Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan” (McElreath, 2016). This package also uses the rstan package (2023) for certain functions. rstan allows the implementation of Stan in R, and was also used to model zooarchaeological NISP data."

    "text": "6.3 Issues and approaches in the quantification of archaeobotanical data\nQuantitative analysis of the archaeobotanical remains collected proved difficult due to several biases in the dataset which, if not controlled, could lead to erroneous results. In fact, the majority of published archaeobotanical material can be attributed to judgemental/feature-based sampling, which introduces biases as outlined in Chapter 3. Given the paucity of Italian archaeobotanical samples available for the period compared to other European countries, and given that many samples contained outliers, it was not possible to adopt a purely quantitative strategy using the raw counts, but the data had to be processed in other ways. Before going any further, let us consider three sites to give a practical example of the outliers that were so common in the dataset: Parma (Piazza Garibaldi/via Cavestro), Miranduolo, Brescia (via Alberto Mario). The sample from the Parma excavation, Piazza Garibaldi/via Cavestro, comes from an urban cesspit and the seeds have been preserved by waterlogging (Bosi et al., 2012, 2011). In this sample, certain taxa skew the distribution and under-represent other plant remains. In the case of the mid 8th to mid 9th century samples from the rural village of Miranduolo, charred samples were taken from layers of a storehouse and storage pits. The outlier here is represented by Triticum aestivum/durum (4,037 seeds) and cereals in general, which have much higher counts compared to legumes or fruits (Buonincontri et al., 2014). In other cases, excavators may have taken samples from layers where a large conglomerate of seeds was visible to the naked eye. For example, in Brescia, via Alberto Mario, a small food store contained a large number of charred seeds of Panicum miliaceum (more than 21,000, after which the researchers stopped counting) and Triticum monococcum (750 seeds). Apart from these taxa, other plant remains were found in much smaller quantities (Castiglioni and Rottoli, 2019). It is clear here how the sampling location affects the type of taxa we might expect to find: cereals are much more common than other taxa in food storage areas, whereas other seeds ingested by humans (figs, strawberries, grapes, etc.) might be expected to be found in cesspits (Smith, 2013). In addition to the biases that may be introduced by the choice of sampling strategies, as discussed in Chapter 3, other problems may arise, for example, from the way in which plant remains are preserved. Once again, Figure 3.2 and Figure 3.3 give a breakdown of the way in which seeds are preserved under different conditions.\nIn order to ignore these sources of bias, we would need a very large dataset so that outliers would have less effect on the calculations. Since this is not the case, we need to take precautions to avoid jumping to false conclusions. The first is to transform the data and the second, discussed later, is to use a statistical modelling approach. When it comes to numerical transformations for statistical analysis, there are several examples and approaches in the scientific literature (Bishop, 2006; James et al., 2021). Unfortunately, none of them are helpful for outliers of this nature; each site presents its own unique problems. Although Heinrich (2017) argues for the need for quantitative archaeobotanical analyses that go beyond presence/absence categories, with the current state of information available for the 1st millennium CE Italian peninsula, this is simply not yet possible. For this reason, most of the analyses of the palaeobotanical dataset presented in this study are based on the presence of particular species in each context (Bastow Wilson, 2012). Numerically, this means that raw counts are converted to 1 to indicate that a taxon is present, and to 0 to indicate that it is absent from a sample. Although much safer than other types of data transformation, this transformation has a strong effect on the data and inevitably changes the range of questions that can be asked of our dataset. Within each sample, the data is flattened and the importance of a taxon relative to other taxa in the same context is lost. Instead of asking questions such as “What was the most abundant plant in Roman rural sites?”, we can only ask “Which plant was most frequently found in Roman rural sites?”.\nIn one case, for demonstration purposes, the samples were transformed in a different way in order to preserve the quantitative information. In Chapter 7 it is possible to see how different strategies affect the quantification of cereals at different stages. This short case study was chosen because cereals are present in most samples (unlike legumes, for example) and because the chronological division is the one that creates the least imbalance in the data. Other groupings, for example based on site type, would have distorted the results as smaller group sizes are unreliable, especially when frequentist approaches to statistics are used. The purpose of the transformations was to see how the proportions of cereals changed over time. In the first example (Table 7.10), simple means were calculated based on the total number of cereals. Whenever a cereal taxon was not present in a sample, its proportion was considered to be 0. In addition, the means are also affected by any other cereal outliers present in the samples. The second example (Table 7.11) shows instead the means calculated on the basis of true presences, excluding missing values (NAs). This type of calculation deals well with zero-inflated columns (i.e. cereal taxa that are rarely present in a sample), but runs the risk of over-representing rare species. Moreover, the results are still biased by the outliers present in the sample. The third example (Table 7.12) uses a different approach. This method involves converting the data into relative ranks using the decostand() function found in the vegan package (Oksanen et al., 2020). This transformation replaces the original count data with their corresponding increasing ranks, while leaving zeros unaffected. The result is that the taxon with the highest abundance is ranked as 1. This process has the effect of mitigating the effects of pronounced variations within the data, effectively smoothing out extreme values. Crucially, however, it preserves valuable information about the relative abundance of taxa. The values in these tables will be commented on later, but what is important to note here is how different strategies yield different figures, and how important it is to be careful when working with biased datasets. The optimal choice, although very limiting, is to work on presence/absence.\n\n6.3.1 Ubiquity\nUbiquity, or presence analysis, is a popular approach in archaeobotanical quantitative analysis. The method is straightforward—the number of sites/contexts where a plant is present is divided by the total number of sites/contexts under examination. If, for instance, an olive pit is present in 3 sites out of 10, the ubiquity for the olive will be 0.30. The formula for the calculation is at follows:\n\\[\nU_x = (\\frac{N_p}{N_{tot}})\n\\] where \\(N_p\\) is the number of presences, and \\(N_{tot}\\) is the total number of contexts.\nThis approach has both advantages and drawbacks. Presence analysis minimizes the impact of outliers (overrepresented plant species) on calculations (Wright, 2010, pp. 51–52), but the relative importance of a plant in a particular context is lost. It is also important to keep in mind that taxa richness is influenced by factors including sample size, deposition and preservation modes, and sampling strategies (e.g. sieving methodologies) (Banning et al., 2000; Pearsall, 2015, pp. 161–2). In general, larger sample sizes tend to produce more diverse assemblages, while smaller assemblages under-represent rarer species (Kadane, 1988; Plog and Hegmon, 1993). Despite these limits, ubiquity is the best option for immediate reading of the botanical dataset of the Italian peninsula. The variability of the seed/fruit assemblages is too high, with different species being outliers in different sites. As mentioned earlier, the probable reason for this is probably the poor quality of sampling, which usually occurs after an agglomerate of seeds is found during excavation. Typically, agglomerates are found in specific storage or processing areas (e.g. wine/olive processing quarters), skewing the distribution of the curve. Ubiquity overcomes this problem by providing a score based on the percentage presence of a plant species in the samples considered.\nIn addition to the general calculation of the diachronic ubiquity across the entire peninsula, it is also important to look for regional differences in the archaeobotanical dataset. To do so, I created an R function to subset data related to northern, central and southern Italian regions. For a clearer reading of the plot, I divided the plants into–Cereals, Pulses and Fruits/Nuts. The results are presented in Chapter 7.\n\n\n6.3.2 Richness and diversity indices\nSpecies richness (\\(S\\)) is the number of species found within a community or ecosystem. The boundaries of the region are defined by the researcher. While ecologists use sampling or censuses to obtain the richness value, archaeobotanists can only rely on sampling, counting the presence of species in the area under investigation (Moore, 2013). Species diversity is a measurement of species richness combined with species evenness, meaning that it takes into account not only how many species are present, but also how evenly distributed the numbers of each species are. There are several diversity indices used in ecology, all of which include abundance in the calculation. Given the biases in the dataset discussed earlier, it is safer to calculate diversity by grouping the assemblages only chronologically, so that the imbalance in the groups is not too high.\nSpecies diversity can be a useful indicator of the centralisation of agricultural practices towards specialised production or the specialised storage/import of specific products. Two diversity indices are commonly used in archaeobotany: the Shannon Equitability Index (\\(E_{H}\\)) and the Simpson Index (D). Both of these measures range from 0 to 1, where a value of 0 indicates an uneven assemblage or low diversity, while a value of 1 indicates maximum diversity. The Shannon Equitability Index (\\(E_{H}\\)) assesses evenness by considering both species diversity and their distribution. In simpler terms, a higher \\(E_{H}\\) score indicates a more balanced spread of individuals among species. Also referred to as the Pielou index, this measure is a variant of the Shannon index (Hill, 1973; Pielou, 1966). Its calculation follows the formula: \\[E_{H} = \\frac{ - \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{S} p_{i} \\cdot \\ln p_{i}}{\\ln S}\\]\nHere, \\(\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{S}\\) indicates the sum across all species, with \\(i\\) ranging from 1 to \\(S\\), representing the total number of species. \\(p_{i}\\) stands for the proportion (relative abundance) of the \\(i\\)th species, and \\(ln\\) signifies the natural logarithm. The term \\(S\\) denotes the total number of species in the ecological community.\nThe Simpson index, on the other hand, is a different measure of species diversity that emphasises dominance within a community. It quantifies the probability that two randomly selected individuals belong to the same species. Higher values of the Simpson Index indicate lower diversity, with greater dominance of a few species (Simpson, 1949). The calculation of the Simpson Index is given by the formula: \\[D = 1 - \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{S} p_{i}^2\\] The terms of this formula are equivalent to the previous ones, with \\(\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{S}\\) representing the sum across all species, with \\(i\\) ranging from 1 to \\(S\\). Again, \\(p_{i}\\) represents the proportion of the \\(i\\)th species. This formula subtracts a calculated integer sum from 1, so that \\(D\\) ranges from 0 to 1, where a value of 0 indicates maximum diversity (each species is equally abundant), and a value of 1 indicates minimum diversity (one species dominates the community).\nExamining both measures together provides a more holistic view of the ecological characteristics of a community. The Shannon Equitability Index emphasises evenness, showing the balance of species distribution, while the Simpson Index highlights dominance and the prevalence of abundant species. The two indices presented above are not the only diversity and equitability indices available in scientific literature. Ecological diversity indices have indeed undergone several stages of critiques, with those advocating for better and more mathematically sound indices and those advocating that ecologists should stop using such indices and move on to other methods, such as multivariate analysis (Barrantes and Sandoval, 2009; Daly et al., 2018; Heip and Engels, 1974; Morris et al., 2014). In summary, although diversity indices can help to read the distribution of species within archaeobotanical assemblages, caution is required in their interpretation.\nIn this study, both diversity indices were applied to each assemblages in the dataset to produce a score. The diversity scores for each site were later modelled using a Bayesian approach, which is explained in more detail in the following sections of this chapter. The mathematical breakdown of the models specific to plant richness and diversity is presented in Section 7.2.\n\n\n6.3.3 Multivariate analysis\nThis research uses multivariate analysis to explore possible relationships within the archaeobotanical dataset under investigation. Univariate analyses can be easily plotted and visualised using bar charts, histograms and density curves. A scatterplot (or scattergram) shows the relationship between two variables by plotting their values on the axes of a graph using Cartesian coordinates. This relationship can also be measured mathematically by calculating a distance between two points on the graph. However, the relationship between more than two variables is much harder to read on a scatterplot, as it would require as many axes as there are variables. If our analysis is exploratory, we may not yet know where to look for correlations. One possible solution is to analyse every combination of two variables in the data set and measure their correlation. This would take too much computing time if the dataset had a large number of variables, i.e. if we were dealing with big data. In addition, we would only be gathering information about the relationship between two variables when there may be another factor influencing a trend or phenomenon. Multivariate statistics has a wide range of applications, including grouping and multidimensional scaling, as well as in machine learning and predictive analysis (Fletcher and Lock, 2005). In this research, multivariate methods have been applied to the botanical dataset, mainly with the aim of (i) testing hypotheses between multiple variables, and (ii) reducing the dimensionality of the data, to assess which variables are the main drivers of change in the datasets, and to examine relationships between these variables. In particular, these methods have been used to test the hypothesis that different cereal farming strategies were adopted between southern and northern Italy in the early Middle Ages.\n\n6.3.3.1 Hypothesis testing: PERMANOVA\nThe importance of statistical significance testing in archaeological applications was discussed in Chapter 2. In this context, concepts such as null hypothesis formulation and p-values were introduced. Within the framework of null hypothesis significance testing (NHST), parametric and non-parametric statistics are two different approaches used to analyse data and make inferences about population parameters. These approaches have different assumptions and are suitable for different types of data and situations. While parametric statistics are more powerful, they assume that data follow certain distributions (i.e. the normal distribution) and are based on parameters such as means and variances. Non-parametric statistics are less strict because they make no assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data. Rather than being based on numerical values, most of these methods are based on the rank or order of the data. Non-parametric statistics are more robust and appropriate in the case of ordinal, nominal, skewed data where the normality condition is not met (Anderson, 1961; Hollander et al., 2015; Kraska-Miller, 2014; Wasserman, 2006; Wu et al., 2017). As the cereal data set, transformed into presence/absence values, does not follow a normal distribution, non-parametric statistics are the more appropriate choice for hypothesis testing. In archaeology, significance tests are commonly used on the means of a group of assemblages to assess whether the assemblages come from the same distribution. In this specific case we will use a non-parametric test, permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA).\nPermutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) is a versatile multivariate statistical test based on permutations. As a semiparametric test, it makes no assumptions regarding homogeneity of variances or normality of data distributions. The test was developed by Marti J. Anderson (2017) as a flexible method for comparing groups of objects in a multivariate context. The primary focus of PERMANOVA is to determine whether there are statistically significant differences in centroids (location) and dispersion (spread) between the different groups being compared. This is achieved by examining measure space, a mathematical representation of the relationships between objects in the dataset. The test operates under a null hypothesis that there are no meaningful differences in centroids and dispersion between the groups. A permutation-based procedure rearranges the observed data in a variety of ways, generating a distribution of possible outcomes under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true (Golland et al., 2005). By comparing the observed test statistic with this permutation-derived distribution, PERMANOVA determines whether the observed differences in centroids and dispersion are statistically significant or could have occurred by chance. Before performing the analysis, it is necessary to calculate the distances between all pairs of objects within the dataset. These distances serve as a basis for assessing the dissimilarities between the objects and can be based on various metrics such as Euclidean distance, Jaccard dissimilarity, Manhattan distance, Bray-Curtis dissimilarity or other measures depending on the data (Anderson, 2001; Bakker, 2023). As the archaeobotanical dataset is examined using a presence/absence approach rather than raw counts, the most appropriate dissimilarity index is Jaccard. This index calculates the dissimilarity between sets of archaeobotanical assemblages and assigns a score to each pair of assemblages so that, given \\(J(Sample_A, Sample_B)\\), a value of 0 means that two assemblages have identical species compositions (all species present or all species absent), while a value of 1 means that the two assemblages have no species in common.\n\n\n6.3.3.2 Dimensionality reduction and ordination\nDimensionality reduction techniques transform high-dimension datasets into a low-dimension ordination space, with the intention of maintaining the geometry and data structure as close as possible to the original dataset. The dimension of a dataset is given by the number of variables (i.e. the columns in the table). As anticipated in Section 6.3.3, as each variable is graphically represented by an axis, it would be virtually impossible to represent more than three axes in a graph. Ordination allows to reduce data dimensionality to usually one to three (at most) dimensions. Moreover, focusing on a reduced number of dimensions reduces the amount of “noise” that can mislead the interpretation (Gauch, 1982). The points generated through ordination techniques (the objects in our dataset) can eventually be plotted in a scatterplot. In most of the ordination methods, points plotting closer together in graph are more similar, whereas points far apart from each other are more dissimilar (Shennan, 1997, p. 197). For instance, one could perform an ordination on a group of burials in a cemetery where each point represents a single burial assemblage. After the ordination it is also possible to group the new reduced set of variables, to observe differences between groups and facilitate the interpretation. In the previous example, a group might be represented by burials of the same ethnic group, status, etc.\nMany of the ordination techniques described in this chapter developed in fields outside archaeology, and are thus borrowed from disciplines as community ecology. Ecologists regularly apply ordination methods for the study of environmental gradients, so that the term “gradient analysis” is often used interchangeably with “ordination”. An environmental gradient refers to variations in site characteristics (e.g. time, elevation, temperature, vegetation, etc.), which in turn can affect biotic factors (e.g. species abundance, diversity, etc.) (Grebner et al., 2013). The purpose of ordination is then to identify the cause of ecological processes in the dataset. Generally, it is possible to apply ordination on datasets in which the variables have a cause-and-effect (e.g. climate vs. plant species) or mutual influences on each other. There are two main types of ordination, or gradient analysis, techniques (see Table 6.1): direct (constrained) or indirect (unconstrained). The objective of indirect (unconstrained) gradient analysis is to identify patterns between samples of ‘dependent variables’ (e.g. which sites are more similar according to their species composition). Conversely, direct gradient (or constrained) analysis includes more information (or tables) in a single analysis—the dependent variables are now constrained to be a function of other sets of ‘independent variables’ (usually environmental proxies). In short, a constrained analysis uses both datasets to find the best possible mathematical relationship between the dependent and independent variables. In this sense, direct gradient analysis can be considered as an extension of unconstrained analysis (Syms, 2008). The choice between using constrained or unconstrained methods for ordination depends on the research questions and on the dataset.\n\n\nTable 6.1: Ordination methods used in gradient analysis.

MDS works with matrices containing Euclidean distances between each pair of observations. Conversely, non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) is a rank-based approach that finds both:\n\nA non-parametric monotonic relationship between the items in the dissimilarity matrix and the Euclidean distances.\nThe location of items in the low-dimensional space.\n\nThe goal of nMDS is to represent the pairwise dissimilarity between items in the matrix as closely as possible. For this reason, it is considered as a good technique for multivariate data visualisation. nMDS can be used on quantitative, qualitative and mixed data. The R function metaMDS() from the package vegan allows users to select the distance metric most appropriate to their data (e.g. Bray-Curtis, Jaccard, etc.). As nMDS is an iterative approach, meaning that the the computations are run until the best solution is found, it can be quite computationally demanding for larger datasets. Although the nMDS algorithm tries to minimize the ordination stress, it is a good practice to compute the ordination stress value to judge the reliability of the solution found (goodness-of-fit). Ordination stress indicates how much distorted are the fitted data when compared to the original observed samples. Stress values can also be visualised with the function stressplot() (vegan package), which produces a Shepard stressplot (Figure 6.2).\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: A Shepard plot, from R Studio Pubs.\n\n\nThe Shepard plot displays the ordination distance against the observed distance. Ideally, the higher the points should fall on a monotonic line, where an increased observed distance is related to an increased ordination distance. Moreover, the higher the number of dimensions, the lower the stress value. If interested in choosing the appropriate number of dimensions, it is possible to use a scree plot which shows the number of dimensions against the stress level. Generally, it is possible to interpret stress values following these guidelines (Dexter et al., 2018):\n\n\nTable 6.2: Ordination stress for the interpretation of nMDS\n\n\nInterpretation\nStress level\n\n\n\n\nExcellent\n&lt; 0.05\n\n\nGood\n&lt; 0.1\n\n\nUsable (but caution is required)\n&gt; 0.2\n\n\nRandom\n&gt; 0.3\n\n\n\n\nIf the solution has produced a good stress level for the number of dimensions required, it is possible to plot the nMDS and interpret the results. Points that plot closer together are more similar, while points that are distant one to each other are more different. The nMDS plot can also be useful in recognising groups (points grouping together and plotting further from other points). An example is provided in Figure 6.3.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: A nMDS plot with clusters, from R Studio Pubs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3.4 Case study: Cereal richness across the Italian subregions\nBoth qualitative and quantitative methods were used to reconstruct the regional differences in cereal farming practices in Italy during the first millennium. In addition to the Bayesian approach, which is described later in this chapter and which is the core of this research, a frequentist approach was also used as a case study to test the validity of the conclusions drawn from the Bayesian models. Before carrying out these statistical analyses, it was necessary to carry out some pre-processing of the data. This involved:\n\nSelecting all the cereals columns from the plant_remains table, keeping the Macroregion column as a categorical variable.\nRemoving rows with no cereals (assemblages reporting only fruits, nuts and legumes but no cereals).\nSelecting assemblages where the total of seeds was greater than 10. The total includes fruits, nuts and legumes in such a way that assemblages poor in grains but rich in other seeds were not of minor importance in the calculations, and were in essence considered reliable. This process resulted in a more limited number of assemblages available for analysis. The assemblage sizes after pre-processing can be viewed in Section 7.4.1.3. Although the lower limit of the allowable assemblage size may appear small (which may affect species richness), some sites reported low numbers of seeds.\nTransforming the raw counts into presence/absence, using the function decostand() (method=pa) in the R package vegan (Oksanen et al., 2020).\n\nMultivariate statistics are used in this research to test the hypothesis of a shift in Italian cereal farming practices and to visualise the separation between macroregions. Due to the small size of the data sets, the statistical methods used in this research are non-parametric or distribution-free, as the data do not follow a normal distribution. As non-parametric statistics make no assumptions about the distribution of the data, they are less powerful than parametric methods, but are flexible and particularly useful when dealing with small datasets (Kraska-Miller, 2014). Two main methods were used: PERMANOVA and nMDS, as described above. After preprocessing, PERMANOVA could be run using the adonis2() function in the vegan package. This function computes a distance matrix using the Jaccard distance and performs an analysis of variance on the matrix. The Jaccard distance is often used in presence/absence analyses because it is not based on Euclidean distances (Kosub, 2019). If the PERMANOVA reports a significant p-value for the selected response variable (in this case Macroregion), it is important to check that the assumptions of the test are met. One of these assumptions is that the variances are homogeneous. To this end, the betadisper() function (also in the vegan package) checks the homogeneity of the variances by calculating the multivariate analogue of Levene’s test for homogeneity of variances, which measures the distances of the group samples from the centroids. The most common test for whether the distances from the centroids are significantly different is to perform an ANOVA on the betadisper() object. If the ANOVA returns a p-value that is not significant (i.e. the p-value is greater than 0.05), it means that the variances of the distances from the centroids are similar between the groups and the assumption of homogeneity of variances is met for the PERMANOVA analysis.\nPERMANOVA was used to test the hypothesis of a separation between northern and southern Italy in two chronological phases. However, this test does not indicate the extent of this separation. For this purpose, nMDS, a non-parametric technique for reducing the dimensionality of a dataset, is useful. Although it is commonly applied by reducing a dataset to two dimensions, following a procedure similar to Cardarelli (2022), the dataset will be reduced to one dimension so that the distance between two density curves can be calculated. nMDS can be computed using the metaMDS() function in vegan, which allows for several dissimilarity measures. The most appropriate measure for this dataset is again the Jaccard distance. In addition to reducing the dimensionality of the dataset, the aim was also to measure the degree of separation between regions using the Wasserstein distance, also known as the Earth Mover’s distance. This measure quantifies the distance between two probability distributions, taking into account the cost of moving mass from one distribution to the other. In order to avoid potentially biased estimates in the calculations, the macroregion of central Italy and the phases LR (late Roman) and Ma (11th century onwards) were excluded from the scaling due to the very uneven sample sizes. These phases are analysed separately using ubiquity only. The nMDS was run with the reduction set to one dimension only, and KDE plots were used to visualise the results. Reducing the dimension to one allows for easier distance calculations using the Wasserstein distance. Finally, the distance was calculated using the wasserstein1d() function in the transport library (Schuhmacher et al., 2022)."

    "text": "6.4 Issues and approaches in the quantification of zooarchaeological data\nWhen compared to the archaeobotanical dataset, the collection of zooarchaeological assemblages allowed for a genuinely quantitative approach, albeit with some challenges. Similar to archaeobotany, most excavations lacked a sampling strategy and instead used feature-based sampling. However, biases are less prevalent in the zooarchaeological dataset. In fact, the bones of primary domesticates such as sheep, goats, cattle and pigs are readily identifiable during excavation, leading to less bias in their representation in the dataset. Nevertheless, small bones, notably those of fish and birds, pose a challenge as they are often underrepresented owing to difficulties in visual identification. Additionally, not all excavations utilized or declared the use of flotation, making it difficult to compare the abundance of these species. The zooarchaeological dataset presents a limited number of outliers. Although a few cases may be cited, these outliers do not have a significant impact on the analysis. This is partly attributable to the dataset’s much larger size compared to the archaeobotanical dataset. Additionally, the inclusion of these outliers may indicate real conditions at the archaeological sites, providing additional reinforcement. For example, let us examine the case of the faunal remains uncovered in Calvatone-Bedriacum from the 4th-5th century CE. The remains demonstrate a significant imbalance between the species present. While the total NISP count for pigs and caprinae amounts to 63, the amount of identified cattle specimens is 919 (Wilkens, 1990). The over-representation of cattle remains in this instance is most likely a result of economic specialisation, possibly due to the slaughter of animals in close proximity to the site.\nGiven that the dataset is generally less biased than the archaeobotanical one and contains fewer outliers, opting to work with counts rather than performing a presence/absence analysis for animals was possible. This choice was also driven by the fact that the major domesticates were consistently present at each site, making presence/absence analysis less informative. Such an analysis might be preferable for examining rare species, assuming that comparable assemblages are used and the process of flotation is consistently applied throughout each excavation. In this regard, the dataset concerning fauna provides more informative data. Unlike archaeobotany, it is feasible to inquire about topics like “Which variety of animal was most abundant on a Roman farm?” or “Is it more likely to find sheep and goats on a medieval mountain site?”\nDespite the greater quantity of assemblages and reduced amount of outliers, the zooarchaeological dataset also presented some problems for quantitative analysis. Because NISP counts must be comparable, it is possible to convert the count data for each assemblages into proportions between 0 and 1. Nonetheless, when dividing the proportions into groups (e.g. by chronology, site type), it becomes clear that each animal’s distribution across sites is overly dispersed, with the curves for each animal being right-tailed (positively skewed). Simply put, the distribution is asymmetric and does not adhere to a normal curve, rendering the interpretation of common measures of central tendency (i.e. mean, median, mode) problematic. Although these measures provide informative insights for normally distributed data, they may mislead the interpretation of right-tailed distributions. In such situations, the mean usually tends to be skewed towards the long tail, resulting in an inaccurate representation of the typical proportion. Similarly, the median may not precisely express the middle value, particularly in circumstances where extreme values dominate the right tail of the distribution. These concerns are addressed through the use of Bayesian statistical modelling, which is introduced later in this chapter."

    "section": "6.5 Building a statistical model",
    "text": "6.5 Building a statistical model\nWhenever dealing with non-normal or skewed distributions, it may be wise to move away from measures of central tendency and model data instead. Creating a statistical model to trace past human activities is a challenging undertaking. Choosing the most suitable predictor (or set of predictors) and response variable to answer our question requires careful consideration of several factors. In archaeology, there is an additional complication because we often cannot select our data and have to work with what is available. The majority of our data is a proxy, or representation, of what we are genuinely interested in. For example, the number of identified specimens of pigs at a particular site is a proxy for how many pigs would actually have been at the site at a particular time. Building statistical models additionally requires taking into account causal inference, particularly when attempting to establish causal relationships between variables. In this study, the use of causal diagrams, also known as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), is used to represent statistical models, showing how “when we draw an arrow from \\(X\\) to \\(Y\\), we are implicitly saying some probability rule or function specifies how \\(Y\\) would change if \\(X\\) were to change” (Pearl and Mackenzie, 2019, p. 45). Understanding the causal pathways and potential confounding factors2 is crucial for precise model formulation and result interpretation. Whenever we have additional predictors available, it is not always advisable to include them all in our mathematical model. Including many variables in a regression may yield “significant” results, but the scientific justification for the incorporation of certain variables may instead be flawed. Furthermore, caution must be exercised as the production of archaeological data involves various intricate processes and is frequently impacted by numerous biases, some of which have already been addressed in this research. Thus, statistical modelling is not only a computational activity but also a meticulous process that amalgamates data, theory, and domain knowledge to yield meaningful insights into intricate phenomena.\nLevins (1966) proposed that a model has three interdependent properties: generality, precision, and reality. Generality denotes the capability of a model to describe a broad range of phenomena. Precision relates to the model’s accuracy in predicting the behaviour of a specific system. Realism, however, concerns the extent to which a model mirrors the actual processes at work in the system being investigated. However, there is a trade-off, as the author suggests that only two of these properties can be improved simultaneously. Figure 6.4 illustrates how various combinations of these properties produce empirical (precision and reality), analytical (generality and precision), and mechanistic (reality and generality) models. Nevertheless, Guisan and Zimmermann (2000) noted that the distinctions between the three model types are frequently not as sharp and that it is possible to achieve a combination of the desired properties with some compromise.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: Illustration of Levins’ models classification. Image after Guisan and Zimmerman (2000, p. 150).\n\n\nAmong the statistical models most frequently used are Generalised Linear Models (GLMs). GLMs should be employed because of their ability to handle a wide range of response variables, including non-normal and categorical variables, and to allow modelling of other distributions. Furthermore, GLMs permit the modelling of non-constant variance functions, particularly valuable in addressing heteroscedasticity, a common issue in many datasets. Once the predictor (\\(X\\), the factor used to make the prediction) and the response variable (\\(Y\\), the factor being explained or predicted) are identified, the subsequent step is to analyse the relationship between the two by correctly formulating the statistical model. The statistical method used for modelling data must be appropriate to the type of data being analysed. When modelling counts of data, a probability density function (PDF) such as Poisson, negative-binomial, and others should be specified. For presence-absence data, various PDFs such as binomial, beta-binomial, and others are necessary (Guisan et al., 2017, pp. 55–56; Guisan and Zimmermann, 2000, pp. 159–160). Each of these distributions possesses distinctive properties and traits that are suitable for modelling certain kinds of data. For example, the Poisson distribution is commonly employed when operating with count data, such as the amount of events of a particular kind taking place within a fixed interval. It presupposes that events happen at a consistent rate and are mutually independent. On the other hand, the binomial distribution is appropriate for modelling binary data, in which outcomes are either success or failure, such as presence or absence.\nAlong with selecting the appropriate probability distribution, choosing a link function is also crucial in statistical modelling. The link function determines the relationship between the predictors and the expected value of the response variable. Commonly used link functions include the logit link for logistic regression (which constrains the outcome variable between 0 and 1), the log link for several types of regression (Gaussian, Poisson, Gamma, etc.), and the identity link for linear regression. Selecting a suitable link function depends on the data type and the specific research question being addressed."

    "section": "6.6 Modeling, the Bayesian way",
    "text": "6.6 Modeling, the Bayesian way\n\n“Bayesian data analysis takes a question in the form of a model and uses logic to produce an answer in the form of probability distributions” (McElreath, 2016).\n\nIn the literature review section we already discussed the rationale behind Bayesian inference, introducing the concept of prior probabilities. The construction of a Bayesian statistical model initially resembles that of its frequentist counterpart, as we begin with a sampling model for observed data (\\(B\\)) given a vector of unknown parameters (\\(A\\)). However, a unique aspect of the Bayesian model is that the unknown parameters are not fixed, but instead are regarded as random. We create a probability distribution for A that summarises any relevant information. This distribution is known as the prior distribution. Prior distributions may have other random parameters which can be assigned other probability distributions, and these parameters are referred to as hyperparameters. Bayes’ Theorem is then used to derive the posterior distribution, which can be viewed as a compromise between our prior knowledge and the data we have gathered (Figure 6.5). In short, if we have prior knowledge or belief about an event, we can use Bayes’ rule to update our belief in light of new data:\n\\[\nP(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\n\\]\nThe probability \\(P (A|B)\\) of a hypothesis \\(A\\) being true, given the observed evidence \\(B\\), is proportional to the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis \\(P (B|A)\\), multiplied by the prior probability of the hypothesis \\(P (A)\\). This is divided by the probability of the evidence \\(P (B)\\) itself, which normalizes the result so that the probabilities sum to one. The resulting probability distribution is called the posterior probability distribution, which quantifies our updated belief in the hypothesis given the observed evidence. More than one hypothesis is plausible, and Bayesian probability theory allows to quantify uncertainty and compare different hypotheses (rather than comparing our hypothesis against a null hypothesis) based on their posterior probability distributions (Gelman et al., 2013, pp. 6–8).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.5: Bayesian updating: The posterior distribution is a compromise between our prior knowledge and the likelihood (observed data).\n\n\n\n\nThere is a catch, however, especially for complex models: the posterior distribution cannot be expressed in closed form and can only be explored by working with samples. These samples in turn can help us to estimate properties of the posterior (e.g. mean, variance, etc.). The challenge is that drawing samples directly from the posterior can be computationally infeasible, especially when dealing with high-dimensional parameter spaces or complex models. The mathematics behind this process is prohibitively difficult (if not sometimes impossible), which is one of the reasons why Bayesian statistics has only taken off in recent years, with increasingly powerful computers. Bayesians have devised several ways of sampling from a posterior distribution, although the method most commonly used in recent years is Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). While it is not possible to give a detailed mathematical explanation of the method here, the logic behind it is relatively straightforward. Imagine walking into a room blindfolded and trying to avoid tripping over furniture. Most people would take small steps in each direction, but if they accidentally tripped over something, they would remember the location of the obstacle. By repeating this process many times, you eventually learn the layout of the room. In a Markov chain, you can take a very large number of steps from a given location, with the next step depending only on where you are. The chain will then be the path you have taken. The ‘Monte Carlo’ part of MCMC refers to the randomness of your path. MCMC allows you to get a general idea of the shape of a distribution, in this case the posterior distribution, to explore its properties (Albert, 2009; Carlin and Louis, 2008, pp. 120–140; Hartig et al., 2011; Marin and Robert, 2014; Robert and Casella, 2010, 2004; Tierney, 1994).\nNow that we have covered the basics of Bayesian inference, let us take a closer look at building a model. As we have seen, once we have collected data and built a DAG, it is necessary to think about any prior beliefs we may have about the phenomenon we are trying to predict. Particularly in archaeology, we may not have a history of previous surveys or strong beliefs about our data. If we cannot feel confident about our prior knowledge, does this mean that we cannot do Bayesian inference? Or should we switch to frequentist statistics if we do not fully accept the subjectivity of the Bayesian approach, but still value its logic? It turns out that certain priors have a weaker influence on the posterior distribution than others. These priors are referred to in various ways: flat, weakly informative, uninformative, diffuse, among others. For the purposes of this study, we label them as ‘weakly informative priors’ as virtually any prior has some impact, albeit minimal, on the posterior distribution. A weakly informative prior does not favour any particular interval of a distribution, and the observed data have a much greater weight on the posterior distribution than the prior. A canonical example of a weakly informative prior in the context of a binomial distribution (constrained between 0 and 1) is the uniform distribution (Figure 6.6). If there is no prior belief regarding the likelihood of an event occurring, using the uniform distribution implicitly says that we believe that the mean occurrence could be anywhere between 0 and 1. It is worth noting that even stronger priors have a minimal effect on the posterior distribution when the sample size is large enough (see Figure 6.7) (Albert and Hu, 2020, p. 344; Banner et al., 2020; Johnson et al., 2022, p. 234; McElreath, 2016, p. 127).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.6: When a uniform distribution is applied as a prior belief, the resulting posterior distribution is influenced more by the likelihood than the prior. This example is for illustrative purposes only and is not based on actual data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.7: An illustration demonstrating how two distinct prior beliefs (dashed lines) converge towards the same true probability \\(p\\) with an adequate number of samples (\\(N\\) = 100). The initial prior follows a beta distribution with \\(\\alpha\\) = 2 and \\(\\beta\\) = 10, whereas the subsequent prior is defined by \\(\\alpha\\) = 8 and \\(\\beta\\) = 3. As the sample size increases, the two distributions converge even more closely.\n\n\n\n\nThis study has exclusively sought to use weakly informative priors in its models for several reasons. Firstly, the sample size of some of the sample groups under examination (e.g., archaeobotanical remains from Roman central Italy) is insufficient for informative priors to be used. When observations are scarce, informative priors pose the risk of outweighing the posterior. On the contrary, a prior that is weakly informative will result in a posterior distribution that more closely resembles the actual data, even with only one observation. Secondly, as the study aims to encompass sites from diverse contexts, which may include varying site types and geographical features, and in light of the dearth of previous statistical studies on the subject, excluding localised studies discussed in the literature review, the adoption of weakly informative priors is deemed more suitable. It is worth noting that although the terms are often used interchangeably, there is a distinction between flat priors (i.e. the uniform distribution) and weakly informative priors (McElreath, 2016, p. 36). The priors used in the models in this research have been carefully constructed so that they do not contain any bias towards any particular interval in the distribution of the data, but at the same time are sceptical of extreme values. We will explore the practical implications of these types of priors when constructing a Bayesian model. For now, let us examine an example. Let us suppose we are developing a model that anticipates the occurrence of cattle in Roman Italy. Cattle were a frequently occurring farm animal during the Roman era, serving as both a source of food and as labour. This information is derived from various literary sources and spans a wide timeframe. Most zooarchaeological studies also confirm widespread presence of this animal in Italy. Although it is possible to find extreme cases, it may be more plausible to assume that, in an archaeological dig, a portion of identified specimens will include cattle, rather than no cattle or only cattle.\nFor this study, we opted for a Bayesian approach as it provides us with a good degree of flexibility and the ease of interpretation. In the Bayesian set of tools there is another valuable resource that goes by multiple names in scholarly literature, namely multilevel models, hierarchical, mixed-effects models, and random-effect models (Albert and Hu, 2020, p. 438; Johnson et al., 2022, p. 375; Kruschke, 2015, p. 557). Among these definitions, Richard McElreath’s term of “models with memory” is particularly compelling (McElreath, 2016, pp. 399–400). However, for clarity purposes we will refer to these as “multilevel models” to avoid any confusion. Before jumping into the multilevel territory, it is necessary to introduce the concept of “pooling” data (Johnson et al., 2022, pp. 377–375). The term simply refers to the grouping of data from various observations, datasets, experiments, and the like. However, the manner in which we pool data can significantly impact the range of questions we can pose to our dataset, and ultimately influence the interpretation of results.\nConsider a data set of \\(N\\) independent samples containing NISP data from cattle that were found in a particular area and that date back to a particular period of time in centuries. If we disregard any attributes that these samples may carry (such as their origin from a rural or urban context, chronology, location, etc.) and pool all the observations together, we are using a “complete pooling” technique. Any outcome of our modelling will depend on the entire dataset, which restricts the range of questions that can be asked but may also lead to misinterpretation. If we study the correlation between a certain altitude and a particular animal and attempt to anticipate the presence of this type of animal at a particular elevation, our inference may be distorted if this correlation varies amongst different time periods. On the other hand, the use of a “no pooling” technique considers each group as independent. This is especially informative for evaluating variability within a group. For example, it allows us to determine how much elevation affects the presence of the animal being examined during specific time periods. However, not pooling the data has a downside: it prevents generalisation. This limitation is particularly significant when dealing with smaller groups, as the utilised method presupposes non-sharing of critical information amongst groups. “Partial pooling” may be the solution to these problems. Bayesian multilevel models possess “memory” as they exchange information among groups. By comprehensively studying each data cluster, the estimates for every cluster are in turn refined and improved. According to McElreath (2016, p. 400), multilevel modelling has four primary advantages:\n\nThe availability of new samples improves the estimates.\nEstimates are improved whenever the group sizes are imbalanced. This prevents groups with more samples available to dominate over smaller groups.\nVariation is explicitly modelled. Multilevel models provide both within-group and between-group variability. Within-group variability tells us how consistent the observations are within a single group. On the other hand, between-group variability provides information on how much observations differ from group to group.\nIt does not require data transformation (i.e. averaging) and preserves the uncertainty in the dataset.\n\nThe rationale for partial pooling and sharing information between groups is straightforward. Our knowledge about a group is not null even when it only comprises a few samples. Imagine entering an unfamiliar café and ordering a coffee. Although the price is unknown, we make an assumption based on previous coffee shop experiences, the cost of living in the city, the appearance of the café, etc. Similarly, it is logical for the model to anticipate specific estimations on the basis of all other groups. However, this does not imply that the model is generating estimates with a high degree of confidence: if the prior we have previously set is weak enough, with a small set of data the expected values will fall within a sufficiently large range, also intuitively known as the “credible interval”.\n\n\n\nExample of various pooling techniques when evaluating the impact of site elevation on the total NISP of a certain species. Initially, every observation is considered independently. In the complete pooling illustration, the overall altitude effect on the total NISP can be seen. Lastly, the effect of site elevation on NISP is stratified by chronology, preserving the variability within each group. Elaboration after Salakpi et al. (2022).\n\n\n\n6.6.1 Building Bayesian models\nWith an understanding of the core principles of Bayesian modelling, let us now explore the process of model building in greater detail while focusing on the dataset employed in this research. Different models have been utilised to analyse archaeobotanical and zooarchaeological data, due to the constraints of the former. After detailing the approaches and distributions utilised in each dataset, this section will also provide guidance on how the models were built, from drawing the causal diagrams to the diagnostics required to check that our models worked.\n\n6.6.1.1 Archaeobotany\nArchaeobotanical data has been exclusively used for presence/absence analysis instead of pure quantitative analysis due to previously explained inherent dataset issues. The most frequently used distribution for modelling presence/absence data is the binomial distribution (García-García et al., 2022; Wypij, 2014), which includes two parameters: N, the number of trials, and p, the probability of success:\n\\[\nY∼Binomial(N,p)\n\\]\nIn its simplest form, a distribution for a single success/failure experiment (N=1) is referred to as a Bernoulli trial (Gelman et al., 2013, p. 39). One of the most common ways to illustrate the binomial distribution is by tossing a coin. Suppose you want to find the probability of getting exactly 3 heads if you flip a fair coin 5 times. In this scenario, \\(N\\) is 5, representing the number of coin flips, and p is 0.5 since each coin flip has an equal likelihood of landing on either heads or tails. Using the binomial distribution formula, you can calculate the probability in the following way:\n\\[P(X = 3) = C(5, 3) \\cdot (0.5)^3 \\cdot (1 - 0.5)^{(5 - 3)} = 0.31\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(C(5, 3)\\) is the binomial coefficient, which is 10 (because there are 10 ways to get 3 heads in 5 coin flips).\n\\((0.5)^3\\) is the probability of getting 3 heads.\nThe probability of obtaining 2 tails when flipping a coin 5 times is \\((1 - 0.5)^{(5 - 3)}\\) since the complementary event to obtaining a head is obtaining a tail.\nThe probability of getting exactly 3 heads on 5 tosses of a fair coin is 0.31, or 31%.\n\nIn Bayesian data analysis, it is essential to present models using mathematical notation. Typically, statisticians list variables and define each one as a function of other variables, whether deterministic or distributional. For instance, consider a Bayesian binomial model constructed to evaluate the extent of “minor” (or more rustic) grains adoption in our dataset’s entire sample. Examining the presence of every cereal grain type is an essential research question. However, one of the aims of this research is to understand the extent to which polyculture was adopted by farmers and other grains besides naked wheats and barley were grown and consumed. Therefore, to achieve this objective, the number of trials, \\(N\\), is limited to seven, which is the maximum number of cereal types stored in the database. Whilst the measurement of cereal richness at a site can be biased by sample size and the use of techniques such as flotation, it remains a valuable proxy for polyculture.\n\\[\nY_{i} \\sim Binomial(N=7, \\bar{p}_{i} )\n\\]\n\\[\n\\bar{p}_{i} \\sim Normal(0,1.5)\n\\]\nIn this model, new parameters are specified in the following line, adhering to the traditional approach of formulating Bayesian statistics. The first line presents the expression Y on the left side, signifying the observed value, and the likelihood function on the right side specifying the probability of the observed data \\(Y\\). If a sample contains three different cereal grain types, for instance, the corresponding formula is \\(3 \\sim Binomial(7, p)\\). Here, the number of cereal types adopted in the specific sample is denoted by “3”, while \\(p\\) represents the probability of each respective minor cereal type being adopted. The Binomial distribution is used to calculate the probability of observing this specific adoption count, given the parameter \\(p\\). To complete the model, a prior distribution for \\(p\\) is assigned to represent our initial understanding of the probability of adopting any “rustic” cereal before any data is observed. Modelling \\(p\\) captures the generative aspect of Bayesian statistics. Bayesian modelling is not solely concerned with describing observed data but also with understanding the underlying process that generates it. To exemplify, the uniform distribution ranging from 0 to 1 is used here to model \\(p\\), but in this study we mostly use other weakly informative priors. Employing Bayes’ theorem enables us to combine the prior and the likelihood to compute the posterior distribution of \\(p\\) based on the observed data. The resulting posterior distribution reflects our updated beliefs about \\(p\\) after taking into account the observed patterns of adoption.\nIn the example given, a “complete pooling” strategy is employed, although as noted earlier, this is only rarely a good idea. In practice, it is important to consider other variables, or predictors, that may affect the occurrence of multiple cereal types. We can construct a causal diagram to display the potential predictors, namely the type of site where the sample was discovered and the chronology of the sample. To adjust for both predictors in the regression at the same time, we implement a trick of developing an interaction index. The index has been constructed to ensure that every site type interacts with every chronology. For example, the interaction between Rural and Roman will be indexed as 1, while the interaction between Rural and Late Roman will be indexed as 2, and so forth. There are several contexts that have been recorded in the database (see Table 5.1 for a full list), but the model required some simplifications in order to avoid extremely small categories. For instance, religious monasteries have been grouped with other Religious sites, or Roman mansiones have been classified as Rural for these models. Categorical simplifications can obscure the nuances of data, but tiny sample sizes produce very uninformative posterior distributions. In essence, we are transitioning to a “partial pooling” approach, where the models incorporate additional levels and provide an intercept for each interaction index (which is why they are also referred to as “varying intercepts” models). We can modify the formula to incorporate a varying intercept:\n\\[\nY_{i} \\sim Binomial(N=7, \\bar{p}_{i} )\n\\]\n\\[\nlogit(\\bar{p}_{i}) = \\alpha_{[TCid]}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\alpha_{[TCid]} \\sim Normal(0,1.5)\n\\]\nWe define the varying intercept as \\(\\alpha\\) and note that \\([TCid]\\) represents the numerical interaction index. We then assign a weak prior to the intercept \\(\\alpha\\), using a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.5. In Figure 6.8 you can see how the prior is weakly informative as it assigns similar probabilities from 0 to 7. Note that the probabilities are randomly assigned as they are generated in the normal distribution. With such a diffuse prior, even one observation will change the posterior density to better reflect the shape of the data:\n\n[… ] with a weakly informed prior that spreads credibility over a wide range of parameter values, it takes relatively little data to shift the peak of the posterior distribution toward the data (although the posterior will be relatively wide and uncertain) (Kruschke, 2015, p. 114).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.8: In this prior predictive simulation, it is evident that a weakly informative prior does not result in any fabricated trends. The x-axis displays counts ranging from 0 to 7, representing the highest number of ‘minor’ grains specified in the binomial model. It is advisable to simulate the potential impact of a chosen prior on a hypothetical posterior distribution.\n\n\n\n\nComparing the complete pooling model to the one with the varying intercept, we observe a difference. In order to include more levels, we are practically constructing a Bayesian GLM, necessitating a logit link function. The logit link is the most common when working with binomial GLMs, mapping a parameter that is defined as a probability mass and effectively constraining it between 0 and 1. When employing the logit link function, it is crucial to note that the intercept estimates obtained from the posterior distribution represent log-odds, which are on a transformed scale (McElreath, 2016, pp. 315–7). To interpret these estimates in terms of probabilities, they must be transformed back to the original probability scale using the inverse logit transformation.\nAfter building the model, we can sample from the posterior distribution and obtain useful information such as group means, within and between group variability, and credible intervals3. A posterior credible interval (CI) quantifies the uncertainty in an estimated parameter obtained from Bayesian inference. Unlike frequentist confidence intervals, which rely on the concept of repeated sampling, Bayesian credible intervals offer a direct statement about the plausible range of the parameter given the observed data and the prior distribution chosen. CIs are selected to encompass specific high-density regions of the posterior distribution, which is why they are also called highest density intervals (HDIs). Common options for credible intervals may include the 95% and 90% credible intervals. However, this study presents several CIs to improve the clarity: 99%, 95%, 80%, and 50%. The objective is to capture the most plausible values of the posterior, excluding the extremes or unlikely scenarios (Johnson et al., 2022, pp. pp-185-186). By representing the likelihood of a parameter falling within a specific range, CIs are more intuitive than confidence intervals4.\n\n\n6.6.1.2 Zooarchaeology\nThe zooarchaeological dataset permitted a more quantitative approach compared to the archaeobotanical dataset, as previously described in Section 6.4. Instead of modelling the occurrence of specific species, it was feasible to directly model counts to evaluate quantitative distinctions between species based on selected stratifying factors, such as chronology, type of context, macroregion, and others. Counts are frequently modelled with a Poisson distribution (Hilbe, 2014, pp. 35–73), which has been used, for example, to model species diversity and richness in the archaeobotanical dataset. However, while it is feasible to use Poisson regression to model comparable counts, it is not advisable to do so when comparing NISP data. The amount of NISP data collected in each sample can vary depending on various factors, including excavation size, number of samples, and richness of the stratigraphic layer. When exploring a single excavation, researchers may ask specific questions such as: “Which area or chronology provided the most bone fragments?”. However, our focus is on understanding the relative occurrence of specific species, which requires investigating different questions: “What is the probability of finding pig remains in a sample from the Roman period?”. This can only be determined through modelling comparable counts. Fortunately, the binomial distribution can be used to simulate relative proportions among species in a different strategy.\nAssuming that \\(Y\\) represents the NISP count for a specific species such as pigs and \\(N\\) (i.e. the number of trials) represents the total NISP from a sample, we can utilise the \\(Y \\sim Binomial(N, p)\\) formula. This approach provides each probability for each sample within the range of 0 and 1 as each sample will be capped at its own total NISP count. We will not elaborate on the construction of a Bayesian binomial regression again, as it has been previously explained, and we can improve on this. In Section 6.4, we explored overdispersion as a major challenge in quantifying zooarchaeological data. This issue arises because several factors can contribute to a particular species dominating in a sample, and the proportions between species and samples are never precise. One immediate approach to address this issue would be to implement ranking (e.g. Assemblage #1, Pigs = 1, Sheep/Goats = 2, Cattle = 3), although at the expense of losing some of the finer details. It is worth noting that whether an assemblage comprises of 300 pig bones, 20 sheep or goats bones, or 10 cattle bones, the rankings would remain the same at 300, 290 and 280 bones respectively.\nThere is an alternative method that considers overdispersion while still allowing us to model our counts with a binomial distribution. To introduce this, we need to take a step back and talk about conjugate priors. As defined by Johnson et al. (2022, p. 62):\n\n“We say that \\(f (π)\\) is a conjugate prior for \\(L(π∣y)\\) if the posterior, \\(f (π∣y) ∝ f (π)L(π∣y)\\), is from the same model family as the prior”.\n\nConjugate priors for the likelihood are an algebraic convenience, as they facilitate otherwise difficult (or impossible) computations. By creating a closed-form expression for the posterior distribution within the same family as the prior, it becomes more straightforward to observe the impact of the likelihood in revising our prior evidence. One of the most frequently utilised continuous probability distributions that are conjugate to the binomial distribution is the Beta distribution. It is defined on the \\([0,1]\\) interval and characterised by two positive parameters, \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\), which can be adjusted to express strong, weak, or neutral prior beliefs. The distribution’s shape may vary as we modify its parameters:\n\nWith \\(\\alpha = \\beta = 1\\), the Beta pdf is uniform.\nWith \\(\\alpha &lt; \\beta\\), the Beta pdf is right-skewed.\nWith \\(\\alpha &gt; \\beta\\), the Beta pdf is left-skewed.\nWith \\(\\alpha = \\beta\\), the Beta pdf is symmetric with mean and mode equal to 0.5.\n\nThe \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) values also provide information on the variability of the probability density function. As these values increase, the pdf becomes narrower, more concentrated around the mean, and less dispersed. It is clear that these qualities are desirable as they provide significant flexibility when selecting a prior belief. How can we benefit from these properties? The solution is to use a beta-binomial model, a mixture model in which each binomial count observation has its unique probability of success, allowing a distribution of probabilities of success to be estimated rather than a singular probability (Kim and Lee, 2017; Lee and Sabavala, 1987; Lee and Lio, 1999; McElreath, 2016, pp. 370–371). Instead of utilising the conventional formulation of the beta-binomial distribution, the reparameterization provided in McElreath was adopted for this study. In this reparameterization, Beta takes on two parameters: a mean probability of \\(p\\) and a scale or precision parameter of \\(\\phi\\)5. The value of \\(\\phi\\) can be determined based on the relationship between \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\), which is such that: \\[\\alpha = p \\cdot \\phi; \\beta = (1-p) \\cdot \\phi\\] Additionally, the Beta-Binomial model, in which \\(p\\) is assumed to follow a Beta distribution:\n\\[\nY \\sim Binomial(N,p)\n\\]\n\\[\np \\sim Beta(\\alpha, \\beta)\n\\]\nCan be reparametrized as:\n\\[\nY \\sim Betabinomial(N, p, \\phi)\n\\]\nThis formulation (which already includes the Beta distribution) is simpler for modelling and interpreting the results since the exploration of a single parameter \\(\\phi\\) provides a clearer understanding of the variability in the posterior distribution. Specifically:\n\nWhen \\(\\phi &lt; 2\\), the distribution is greatly overdispersed, leading to a possible concentration of probabilities around 0 and 1.\nWhen \\(\\phi = 2\\), the distribution is uniform (flat).\nWhen \\(\\phi &gt; 2\\), the distribution becomes increasingly narrow and the probabilities are more concentrated.\n\nWith these concepts in mind, we can begin constructing a beta-binomial model to evaluate its practicality. Let us examine a case in this study. Extending the binomial model previously used to calculate pig occurrence, we shift our focus back to the multilevel realm. As a recap, a multilevel model allows us to model counts while retaining information about variation between and within groups, and about group sizes (through credible intervals). Furthermore, multilevel models improve estimate accuracy for small groups by gathering information from other groups through partial pooling. Having constructed a DAG, we are interested in knowing the predicted occurrence of pig remains on different site types, stratified by chronology. Just as in the previous binomial archaeobotanical example, we introduce a trick to map the interaction between each of the site types and each of the chronologies: an interaction index. We define the variable intercept as \\(\\alpha\\) and clarify that \\([TCid]\\) signifies the numerical interaction index. Consistent with our earlier example, we also assign \\(\\alpha\\) a weakly informative prior of \\(Normal(0,1.5)\\). To establish a prior for the shape parameter \\(\\phi\\) of assuming that any \\(\\phi\\) value below 2 would result in excessive dispersion, we aim to establish a flat beta distribution as a baseline (Kerman, 2011). In order to proceed, a prior distribution with a minimum of 2 is required. McElreath (2016, p. 371) recommends the use of an exponential distribution, which has a minimum of 0. Therefore, two is added to the \\(Exp(1)\\) generative model (compare Figure 6.9 and Figure 6.10). The interaction index \\({[TCid]}\\) is also added to the prior \\(\\phi\\) in order to get varying estimates for each site type and chronology.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.9: Example of a beta distribution using a precision parameter generated randomly from an exponential distribution with a rate of 1 and then adding a constant of 2. This type of prior is considered weakly informative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Φ + 2; The simulation shows how when no data is available values on the limits are likely. New observations however rapidly affect the posterior distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Φ; The simulation shows how when no data is available the probabilities pile up on the extremes.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.10: Prior predictive simulation for the betabinomial distribution with and without the addition of the constant 2.\n\n\nAfter constructing the hierarchical model and sampling from the posterior distribution, we obtain valuable information about two key parameters for each group (e.g., Roman: Rural, Roman: Urban, etc.). These parameters are the varying intercept \\(\\alpha\\) and the precision parameter \\(\\phi\\). Analysing the distribution of \\(\\phi\\) within each chronology and site type enables us to assess the model’s performance and accuracy. The distribution of \\(\\alpha\\) offers insights into the central tendency of probabilities of occurrence, helping us identify where these probabilities are most concentrated. Additionally, it provides us with credible intervals that can vary in width based on the available data and the degree of variability within each group. A wider credible interval for \\(\\alpha\\) suggests more uncertainty about where the group’s probability is centred. On the other hand, the parameter \\(\\phi\\) is complementary as it informs us about the dispersion or variability within each group. A flat and wide distribution of \\(\\phi\\) values suggests higher uncertainty or variability in estimating the precision parameter across different groups. This variability can arise due to factors such as limited data, inherent heterogeneity, or weak prior information. Conversely, a narrow distribution of \\(\\phi\\) values indicates lower uncertainty or variability in estimating the precision parameter across different groups. This suggests that the groups are more consistent in terms of their data dispersion, and the precision parameter is estimated with greater confidence. As we anticipated, low \\(\\phi\\) values suggest that the data within a group are highly dispersed or variable, with observations deviating significantly from each other. High \\(\\phi\\) values (far from zero) imply that the data within a group are less dispersed or variable, with observations clustering closely together (Figure 6.11). To clarify, while both credible intervals and \\(\\phi\\) values provide insights into dispersion, credible intervals focus on the central tendency of probabilities, while \\(\\phi\\) measures the dispersion of the data points themselves within a group. They offer complementary information to understand how groups behave and how variable their probabilities are.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.11: The plots illustrate the behaviour of Φ across various probability levels for different values.\n\n\n\n\nThe beta-binomial multilevel model presented in this section has enabled us to offer reliable estimates for the abundance of a selected species in each site type and chronology. This example has laid the foundations for understanding the logic behind Bayesian model building, although the results section will provide estimates using multiple other predictors. These models address over-dispersion through several methods. Firstly, they introduce an observation-level varying effect (Harrison, 2015) while also permitting each combination of predictors to have an unobserved intercept (McElreath, 2016, p. 372). We can then obtain estimates of these intercepts via posterior predictive. Nonetheless, it would be prudent to verify that our model has operated accurately before doing so. The following section will explore the necessary diagnostics that must be conducted to ascertain the model’s ability to generate precise estimates. It will also explain the methodology for interpreting posterior predictive simulations and comparing various models to determine the most fitting one.\n\n\n\n6.6.2 Sampling from the posterior and model diagnostics\nIn Section 6.6, we looked at a stochastic process based on MCMC. This process can be used to estimate posterior probability distributions. Following a mathematical notation outline of the Bayesian model, the model must be translated into code. Ideally, prior (or priors) simulations should be conducted at this stage to ensure that the models behave appropriately and that incorrect prior specifications do not bias the results. There are various probabilistic programming languages and R packages that can be used to create Bayesian models. These R packages often act as compilers for the Bayesian engines. The two most prevalent languages are BUGS/JAGS (Lunn et al., 2009; Plummer, 2003), which can be incorporated into R with nimble (Goldstein et al., 2021; Valpine et al., 2017), rjags (Plummer et al., 2023), and bayesmix (Gruen and Plummer, 2023) packages, and Stan (Gelman et al., 2015), which can be utilised through rstan (2023), rstanarm (Goodrich et al., 2023), and brms (Bürkner, 2017). This study utilises the STAN-based package, rethinking (McElreath, 2023), which is dependent on rstan for fitting basic models. Other more advanced models, such as the multilevel beta-binomial described above, are instead written directly in STAN and fitted using rstan. To demonstrate the difference between writing a model in R and in Stan, two examples are provided. The following example uses the ulam() function in the rethinking package to fit a multilevel poisson model. This package has the benefit of making it relatively easy to translate a mathematical model into code, as the model specification follows the same structure.\n\nlibrary(rethinking)\n\nm1 &lt;- \n  ulam(\n    alist(\n1        Richness ~ dpois( p ),\n2        log(p) &lt;- a[Chronology] + b[Observations],\n3        a[Chronology] ~ dnorm(3,0.5),\n4        b[Observations] ~ dnorm(0,0.2)\n    ), \n    data=dat.Plants_Richness, \n5    chains=4,\n6    log_lik=TRUE\n    )\n\n\n1\n\nDefining the model formula.\n\n2\n\nModelling p (using the log-link function) in terms of chronology and adding an observation-level varying effect.\n\n3\n\nSetting a prior for the chronology intercept.\n\n4\n\nSetting a prior for the observation level slope.\n\n5\n\nDefining the number of Markov chains.\n\n6\n\nSetting log_lik = T to enable model comparisons (with WAIC).\n\n\n\n\nWhen compared to other modelling techniques, designing a model in Stan necessitates meticulous outlining of all data variables and parameters. Moreover, the varying effects cannot be implicitly inferred but need to be defined through for loops and suitable indices. The code snippet below provides the code used to build a beta-binomial model in Stan.\n\n1data{\n  int&lt;lower=0&gt; J;\n  array[J] int N;\n  array[J] int A;\n  array[J] int Chronology;\n}\n2parameters{\n  vector[4] a;\n  array[4] real&lt;lower=2&gt; phi;\n}\n3model{\n  vector[J] pbar;\n  a ~ normal(0, 1.5);\n  phi ~ exponential(1);\n  for ( i in 1:J ) {\n    pbar[i] = a[Chronology[i]];\n    pbar[i] = inv_logit(pbar[i]);\n  }\n  \n  vector[J] phi_l;\n  vector[J] pbar_l;\n  vector[J] beta_c;\n  for ( i in 1:J ) {\n    phi_l[i] = phi[Chronology[i]];\n    pbar_l[i] = pbar[i]*phi_l[i];\n    beta_c[i] = (1 - pbar[i]) * phi_l[i];\n  }\n4  target += beta_binomial_lupmf(A | N, pbar_l, beta_c);\n}\n\n\n1\n\nDefining input data variables.\n\n2\n\nDefining model parameters. Note that \\(\\phi\\) has a lower boundary of 2, for the reasons detailed before.\n\n3\n\nDefining model formula and priors.\n\n4\n\nDefining target function.\n\n\n\n\nThe Stan code must be implemented and compiled in R using the rstan package, as shown in the code snippet provided.\n\nm2 &lt;- stan(\n1  file = \"model.stan\",\n  data = dataset,    \n2  chains = 4,\n3  warmup = 1000,\n4  iter = 4000,\n  cores = 4,              \n)\n\n\n1\n\nPath of Stan file “model.stan”.\n\n2\n\nNumber of Markov chains.\n\n3\n\nWarmup iterations per chain.\n\n4\n\nTotal number of iterations per chain.\n\n\n\n\nIn both cases, the MCMC method is used for posterior sampling, with diagnostic information on the model’s fit available through the rstan and rethinking packages. The convergence tells us if the model has worked and most R packages terminate when convergence cannot be reached or the Markov chains appear poorly mixed. In addition, these packages offer instruments to evaluate the effective sample size, which is an estimate of the number of independent samples obtained from the MCMC run. A low effective sample size may indicate poor mixing or autocorrelation in the Markov chains, suggesting that more samples are needed for reliable inference. Furthermore, both packages provide trace plots and density plots of the posterior samples, enabling users to visually inspect the behaviour of the chain and the posterior distributions.\nThese diagnostic tools are necessary to ensure that the Bayesian models have converged and yielded dependable outcomes. Good convergence is generally reached with an Rhat (\\(\\widehat{R}\\)) value near to 1. Rhat measures the convergence of multiple chains (Vehtari et al., 2021). Table 6.3 shows the output of the example model m2 using the rethinking function precis(). For diagnostic purposes, the columns n_eff (representing the effective sample size) and Rhat are of particular significance. In this instance, we can observe how the chains were sampled efficiently, and achieved convergence at 1. It is also helpful to visually inspect the chains to see if there has been good mixing (Figure 6.12). A ‘healthy’ chain should be fuzzy and ideally look like a caterpillar (for this reason traceplots are sometimes referred to as caterpillar plots). The posterior distributions in the results section were sampled only when the models had converged (\\(\\widehat{R} = 1\\)), the chains mixed efficiently, and the effective sample size (n_eff) was sufficient. Consequently, traceplots were not included in the results to prevent cluttering the text.\n\n\nTable 6.3: Output of precis(m2).

All parameters require inspection. The shaded region illustrates warm-up iterations, with 4000 iterations per chain in total. Overall, this plot indicates a good mixing.\n\n\nOnce the model is ready and the traceplots indicate a good mixing of the chains for the posterior sampling, it is possible to visually inspect the estimates produced. For this purpose, we employ two packages, which enable the extraction of posterior draws with ease. The first package, tidybayes (Kay, 2023), presents a range of graphics options and functions to plot estimates that are categorised by the chosen parameter. The second package is an extension of tidybayes, called tidybayes.rethinking, which is tailored to models that rely on the rethinking package. These packages provide a variety of visualisation options. We have chosen to display interval bars showing four credible interval ranges (.99, .90, .80, .50) and a mean probability represented by a circle specifically in the context of intercept estimation. This is to facilitate understanding for those who are not accustomed to reading density graphs or to considering estimate intervals rather than means. An illustration of the graph is given in Figure 6.13 below as an example. The highest density intervals, or 0.50 credible intervals, indicate the range of values where the probability density is relatively high, focusing on the areas where the data and prior information offer the greatest support.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.13: Example poisson regression output from m1. The graph displays the predicted richness of plant species per varying intercept (chronology), represented on an inverse log scale as a result of the use of a link function to return it to the original scale. It is evident that the Roman (R) credible interval is shorter due to a higher number of samples with less variation. The Ma chronology (11th century onwards) has a broader credible interval due to a smaller sample size. If a stronger prior were selected, the credible intervals would be shorter. The red line indicates the overall mean.\n\n\nRegarding beta-binomial models that involve estimating the \\(\\phi\\) parameter, we selected an alternative visualisation to prevent any confusion for the reader. The precision parameter estimate graphs are presented similarly to the intercept graphs, with density distributions showing the shape of the distribution. Each line is also plotted with two probability intervals — 0.65 (represented by a shorter, thicker line) and 0.99 (represented by a longer, thinner line). In relation regression models with numerical predictors (such as elevation, temperature, and precipitation), we plotted estimates using credible intervals at .95, .80, and .50, avoiding intervals that were excessively large (i.e. .99) and could have made interpretation of any specific trend difficult. The plots display either a positive or negative correlation as indicated by the slope, and the width of the interval changes according to the sample size and variability.\nFinally, for some models, an attempt was made to produce community plots, combining the estimates of several models to provide information on particular temporal trends or interactions between species, to answer questions such as “Which species were similarly abundant? What is the degree of separation between two species? Which species has the largest or smallest variability in its estimates?”. As noted in the results section, combining estimates from different models is not a precise procedure and a multivariate modelling approach would be more suitable. However, since the models were generated using the same formula and parameters, it is nonetheless informative to look at these graphs to get a broader view of the general trends. Such plots can be interpreted by displaying the predicted probability of occurrence (restricted between 0 and 1) on the x-axis, while on the y-axis, the slope coefficient indicates whether there is a positive or negative correlation in numerical regressions (e.g. Figure 8.38). Alternatively, in other instances (e.g. Figure 8.4), probabilities can be plotted against the precision factor \\(\\phi\\).\nIn Bayesian modelling, it is essential to make model comparisons. Various methods exist for model comparison, such as AIC, BIC, DIC, and PSIS, each serving a different purpose (Albert and Hu, 2020, pp. 314–316, 530–533; Kruschke, 2015, pp. 266–295). We will introduce the Widely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC) for simplicity. The WAIC is the logarithm of the predictive posterior density (lppd) with a penalty term proportional to the variance in the posterior predictions. We will not elaborate on the mathematical details, but it is important to note that it provides a more robust approach that takes into account model flexibility and predictive accuracy. To additionally handle overfitting due to an increased number of parameters, the results also present pWAIC alongside WAIC (Gelman et al., 2014; McElreath, 2016, pp. 220–221; Vehtari et al., 2017). It is worth considering that WAIC (and other equivalent measures) are exclusively designed to compare models to help determine which model is preferable when we have models that are equally plausible (assuming our causal inference is correct). This is accomplished by assessing the models out-of-sample, meaning how well they perform with data that was not seen during their fitting process (i.e. how well they generalise to new data). To comprehend the results, the specific WAIC value alone is not significant, but rather used to evaluate the model with the lowest value. The model with the lowest value indicates a better model performance. In addition to WAIC, other graphical tools such as posterior predictive checks and visual comparisons of model predictions to observed data, can provide useful feedback on model performance.\n\n\n\n\nAlbert, J., 2009.

    "section": "7.1 Ubiquity",
    "text": "7.1 Ubiquity\nIn Chapter 6, we concluded that due to the numerous biases present in the sample, dealing with the archaeobotanical dataset warrants the use of a presence/absence analysis. One of the most prevalent types of presence/absence analyses for archaeobotanical remains is ubiquity. Technically speaking, ubiquity is a frequentist approach that only describes the presence of a particular species in a certain number of contexts. While there exist uncomplicated Bayesian substitutes, they still demand a certain degree of modelling or individual handling of each taxon purposes1. This level of detail is prohibitive for exploratory purposes. With this aim, ubiquity has been calculated (a) for each century, (b) for each Italian macroregion, stratified by chronological phase.\nThe heatmap in Figure 7.1 provides a good overview of the temporal trends of presence of cereals, legumes, fruits and nuts in the entire area under examination. Despite some trends are visible, it is important to remember that these results are just exploratory and they need to be compared with other predictors (i.e. context type, macroregion, etc.). The chart additionally presents the scientific names of all plants being researched, thereby allowing the usage of common English names later in this chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.1: Diachronical heatmap of recorded plant species\n\n\n\n\n7.1.1 Macroregional trends\nIn addition to investigating the ubiquity of each plant in every century, diachronic trends can also be derived by utilising the chronology and Italian sub-regions as predictive factors. This approach is only used as an initial form of data exploration, although this type of data stratification is risky with a data set that is not large enough. Sub-groups, such as Roman: central Italy, may not be informative due to their size. It is not feasible, for example, to carry out this research at the level of centuries. To subset the data from the northern, central and southern Italian regions, the R function Ubiquity_macroreg_chrono() (see ‘Custom functions’, Online Supplementary Materials) was created. To improve the readability of the plots, we categorised the taxa into cereals, legumes and fruits/nuts. We excluded some dataset columns, such as fruits that were only present in a few sites, from the plot.\n\n7.1.1.1 Cereals\nDuring the Roman age, cereals were commonly grown in both southern and northern Italy, with a few exceptions such as einkorn, rye, oats, and proso millet. Unfortunately, only three sites in Roman central Italy provided botanical assemblages, and their values have been omitted from the graph. The Roman Peasant Project (Bowes, 2020) has investigated these sites in Tuscany and has found three types of cereal: free-threshing wheats, emmer wheat and barley. Comparable ubiquity figures in both northern and southern Italy during the Roman age may imply similar production patterns throughout the Italian mainland, but more data is necessary. In the late Roman period, data on crop prevalence has been analysed for three macroregions, with southern Italy displaying the lowest reliability due to data being available for only five sites. The central Italian sites demonstrate that three crops are prevalent on 62.5% of the sites - free-threshing wheats, barley and emmer. Although other cereals are present, they are not as widespread. This triad of cereals is also widespread in southern Italy. Conversely, in the north of Italy, although free-threshing wheats and barley were important crops, they had to compete with other cereals such as millet, sorghum and rye. The latter crop witnessed a significant increase and was present in nearly 30% of the northern sites (as opposed to the Roman 16%). The early medieval period appears to have marked a shift in Italian agricultural practices, leading to greater regional variability in cereal production. In southern Italy, free-threshing wheats, barley, and emmer formed the main cereals during medieval times. These cereals are also prevalent in central and northern Italy, although these regions practise polyculture with a diverse range of cereals. The small number of samples from this period is due to the project’s chronological limit, which ends at the 11th century. Despite the brevity of the chronology, we can still make certain observations. Central Italy during the 11th century heavily relied on free-threshing wheats, barley, and emmer, whereas other more rustic cereals played a more minor role. Barley is the most prevalent cereal in northern Italy during this period, succeeded by free-threshing wheats, millets, and sorghum.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.2: Diachronical heatmap of cereals in the Italian macroregions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.1.2 Legumes\nIn ancient Italy, legumes were grown for a number of reasons: they provided protein for human consumption, nitrogen for the soil and fodder for livestock. In southern Italy, during the Roman phase, vetch (Vicia sativa minor) and broad beans (Vicia faba) are present in 31% and 22% of the samples, respectively, while lentils (Lens culinaris) are present in 40% of the sites. During the late Roman age, broad beans were equally significant in central and northern Italy, with garden peas (Pisum sativum) present in 50% of the Central Italian sites. In the early medieval period, pulses were present in many central Italian sites, notably blue and red peas (or grass peas, Lathyrus cicera/sativus), broad beans, and others. Lentils and broad beans are also cultivated in nearly half of the northern Italian sites. The significance of pulses in central Italy is corroborated by the 11th century samples, as each species is prevalent in over 50% of the sites and Fabaceae can be detected in every sample. Broad beans were also found in 66% of the northern Italian sites.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.3: Diachronical heatmap of pulses in the Italian macroregions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.1.3 Fruits and nuts\nAmong the most commonly cultivated fruits in the Italian peninsula, olives and grapes were probably the most economically important species. Being sensitive to cold temperatures, olives are not surprisingly more prevalent in southern Italy, where they were found in over 88% of sites dated to the Roman phase and more than 58% of sites in later chronologies2. The cultivation of grapes played a significant role in the Italian agricultural landscape, exhibiting notably high ubiquity values in Roman southern Italy and in late Roman central Italy. Other fruit trees were also grown. The scores for their ubiquity varied, possibly because these species are present in smaller quantities in the excavations. This is especially true when the excavations are aimed at specific storage structures. Therefore, it may be more advantageous to investigate trends in fruits and nuts as collective categories, such as commonly domesticated fruits, rarer and wild fruits, and nuts. This is what we will do in the Bayesian models.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.4: Diachronical heatmap of fruits/nuts in the Italian macroregions"

    "section": "7.2 Site richness and diversity by chronology",
    "text": "7.2 Site richness and diversity by chronology\nSpecies richness is a measure used in ecology consisting simply in the counts of species found at a certain location. In archaeology, it can be informative for assessing how many different plants were found at a site. For the calculation, only sites that provided cereals, legumes, fruits and nuts have been used. Although this choice entails the loss of many observations, it was necessary in order to produce more credible and comparable results. The graphs below show extended credible intervals for groups with fewer observations.\nThe objective of the model was to determine the average plant diversity in each chronological sequence. A Poisson distribution was selected for the model as it is utilized when counts do not have a set upper limit (in contrast to a binomial distribution). The outcome variable is the richness (\\(R_{i}\\)) for each site \\({i}\\), calculated as follows\n\\[ R_{i} = \\sum_{n=1}^{k} Species_{ni}\\] where \\(k\\) represents the total number of species in a given site. The aim is to model the average richness \\(\\lambda_{i}\\). The regression involves computing four intercepts, one for each chronology \\(ChrID\\), in addition to a varying slope for each observation (\\(\\beta_{[Observations]}\\)). This will later help in quantifying the average deviation of the observations from the mean in each chronology (\\(\\alpha_{[ChrID]}\\)). The Poisson regression formula is as follows, with weakly informative priors selected for the intercept and slope to ensure that the range of possible \\(\\lambda_{i}\\) values stays within the outcome space:\n\\[R_{i} \\sim Poisson({\\lambda}_{i})\\]\n\\[log {\\lambda}_{i} = \\alpha_{[ChrID]} + \\beta_{[Observations]}\\] \\[\\alpha_{[ChrID]} \\sim Normal(3,0.5)\\] \\[\\beta_{[Observations]} \\sim Normal(0,0.2)\\] The results illustrate that, within the 0.50 credible interval, the predicted species richness during the Roman and Late Roman period is approximately 9-10 species, which increase up to 12 species during the early medieval period, and between 14.5-16.5 post the 11th century; however, the credible interval is wider because of the scarce sample size. Despite their larger credible interval, even the most extreme values within the 0.99 credible interval have a minimum of 12 species, suggesting greater species richness during this period. When considering the varying effect, which illustrates the predicted deviations of each site from the mean (stratified by chronology), the samples from the 11th century onwards exhibit greater variability. Conversely, the samples from the Roman and Late Roman periods appear to form a more cohesive set of sites in relation to the number of species present. The median deviation of each site from the mean is consistently below one species in all chronologies.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.5: Prior predictive simulation for the Poisson model demonstrates the unlikelihood of obtaining more extreme values after crossing a certain threshold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.6: The graph shows the predicted richness of plants in the four examined chronologies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.7: The graph illustrates the predicted deviations from the mean, stratified by chronology, and reveals that Roman and Late Roman samples exhibit a reduced variability regarding plant richness.\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast to taxon richness, taxon diversity considers the abundance of each taxon. It should be noted that in this dataset, this measurement can be skewed by samples where one taxon dominates to an extreme degree. For example, a sample collected from a processing or storage area is likely to exhibit one taxon that dominates the others. Although this was the reason for choosing to work with presence or absence data in this research, diversity indices are nonetheless provided for the sake of completeness. Specifically, we have computed two indices - Shannon equitability (\\(E_{H}\\)) and Simpson (\\(D\\)) - that range from 0 (complete inequality) to 1 (maximum diversity). These calculations can be performed using the vegan ecology R package functions. Only complete observations, consisting of cereals, pulses, and fruits/nuts, were considered for the calculation of richness indices. After computing both indices for each sample, these values were modelled using a beta distribution because it is bounded between 0 and 1. The resulting equation is as follows: \\[ D_{i} \\sim Beta(\\mu_{i}, \\phi_{i})\\] \\[logit(\\mu_{i}) = a_{[ChrID]}\\] \\[a_{[ChrID]} \\sim Normal(0,1.5)\\] \\[\\phi_{i} \\sim Exp(0.1)+2\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.8: Prior predictive simulation for the Beta model demonstrates that, without any data, any value between 0 and 1 is possible.\n\n\n\n\nBoth indices have a range of values from 0 to 1, but they differ in their calculation methods (Nagendra, 2002). Therefore, direct comparisons between the values of \\(E_{H}\\) and \\(D\\) should not be made, even when displayed in the same figure. Rather, the relative trends within each index should be considered. Although the credible intervals differ (larger for the Simpson index due to increased variability between samples), the trends in diversity across chronological groups remain similar. During the Roman period, there was a lower diversity phase, followed by a slight increase in diversity in the Late Roman period and a subsequent decrease in the early medieval period. However, diversity then increased once more in the post-11th century samples. Nonetheless, the credible interval for this group is considerable and thus the results must be interpreted with caution.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.9: The graph shows the predicted diversity of plants in the four examined chronologies."

    "section": "7.3 Context type",
    "text": "7.3 Context type\nAfter examining the principal chronological trends for plants’ distribution during the first millennium, we may add another factor to our inquiry, namely site type. We can expect dissimilar plants in a funerary context than in an urban site. Stratification of the dataset by site type is possible, but there is a challenge: the four chronologies we are studying also affect the availability, frequency and economic dynamics of site types. For example, the agricultural strategies employed by rural villas during the Roman and late Roman periods could differ based on political and economic events, which could affect the presence of certain taxa. We begin by drawing a directed acyclic graph (DAG), which illustrates how the Chronology node functions as the parent node of Site_Type, and it affects the Plant_Present value directly and indirectly through Site_Type. To account for this “backdoor path” (Pearl and Mackenzie, 2019), we block by Chronology and stratify the dataset by Site_Type. Since we have two categorical predictors of interest, an interaction index variable can be utilised to create separate intercepts for each chronology and context type. For instance, the Roman:Rural context type could be assigned an index of 1, while Roman:Urban could be assigned an index of 2, and so on. This interaction dummy index (\\({[TCid]}\\)) will determine the variation in intercepts (\\(\\alpha\\)) across different context types. This is described in Section 6.6.1.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.10: This is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that represents the relationship between Chronology, Site_Type, and plant presence in the study. Chronology is shown as a collider variable, and its influence on plant presence is mediated through Site_Type. To block the backdoor path between Chronology and plant presence, the dataset is stratified by Chronology.\n\n\n\n\nTo assess the probability of the presence of a single or multiple taxa in each chronology and context, we opted to utilise a Binomial distribution. The \\(F\\) (an abbreviation for the term ‘found’) outlined on the left-hand side of the formula denotes the outcome variable - an indicator of presence/absence for the observation \\(i\\). If there is only one taxon, this value can either be 0 (absent) or 1 (present), with \\(T\\) (i.e. the number of trials) equalling 1. This effectively makes the Binomial distribution equivalent to a Bernoulli distribution. If the model includes more than one taxon, \\(T\\) represents the total number of taxa being modelled. For example, in the case of free-threshing wheats and barley, the model aims to evaluate the likelihood of these grains being present at a specific site type within a certain chronology. In this instance, the value of \\(T\\) for ‘noble’ grains is 2. The outcome variable \\(F\\) denotes the quantity of different ‘noble’ grains discovered on a specific site \\(i\\), with values ranging from 0 (no grains located) to 2 (the site contains both barley and free-threshing wheats). While it deviates from typical binomial distribution usage, this modification was essential because this study is handling presence/absence statistics. The model presented here is intercept-only, where the intercept \\(\\alpha\\) holds an interaction index \\({[TCid]}\\). The model produces estimates for each context type and chronology under investigation.\n\\[\nF_{i} \\sim Binomial(T, \\bar{p}_{i} )\n\\]\n\\[\nlogit(\\bar{p}_{i}) = \\alpha_{[TCid]}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\alpha_{[TCid]} \\sim Normal(0,1.5)\n\\]\nThe rationale behind choosing a normally distributed prior for the intercept \\(a\\) is that it is weakly informative. Below, a simulation of the intercept prior.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.11: Prior predictive simulation for the binomial models used in this section. If for instance we want to know how many minor grains (out of seven types) each site was adopting, this prior is weakly informative because it shows no trends.\n\n\n\n\nDuring the Roman period, free-threshing wheats and barley were primarily found on rural sites, where the predicted probability of occurrence (with a credible interval of 0.50) ranged between 0.68-0.78. The trend is positive, with an increase in predicted occurrence in later chronological phases. There is also an increasing tendency, although to a lesser extent, for urban sites and villas (at least until this type of settlement was abandoned). One site type consistently shows a strong presence of these grains from the late Roman to the medieval period: fortified sites (castra). Indeed, fortified settlements also exhibit a substantial presence of other types of cereal grains, including emmer, einkorn, and millets. If the average expected occurrence of more rustic grains throughout each chronology and type of site is approximately 0.31, in fortified sites, the average is about 0.65 during the late Roman and medieval eras and 0.59 during the early medieval period. In rural sites, too, rustic grains increase from the Roman to the early medieval period, reaching a peak of 0.43 in the medieval period and falling to 0.30 (but with a considerable credible interval) in the latest period after the 11th century. This pattern is also evident in urban and villa sites, which exhibit acceptably narrow credible intervals. However, credible intervals for religious sites, despite showing interesting results, are too wide due to their small group sizes.\nRegarding legumes, reliable conclusions can be drawn for most site types up until the 11th century. However, the length of credible intervals for religious sites makes any major informative conclusion uncertain for this site type. Legumes appear to always be a part of the rural landscape, found in both rural sites where pulses were particularly present during the early medieval (HDI = 0.30-0.34) and medieval (HDI = 0.25-0.34) periods, as well as in rural villas. In fact, during the early medieval period, probabilities increased in villas as well, with an HDI of 0.16-0.22. This trend is mirrored in urban sites as well. While probabilities during the Roman age hover below the mean of 0.25, the early Middle Ages witness a rise with an HDI of 0.25-0.30, reaching a peak in the later phase with an HDI of 0.28-0.37. This signals a notable uptick in the significance of pulses in the diet and farming. If the mean estimate of legume occurrence is consistently around 0.15 within necropoleis from the Roman to the early medieval period, then it is notable that legumes were important offerings at religious sites. During the Roman period, their significance ranged between 0.30-0.40, whereas in the early medieval period it was between 0.30-0.45. Regrettably, this group is relatively limited, and further observations are required from religious sites, as there were no late Roman samples, and the medieval samples show excessively wide credible intervals. While fortified sites display a wide credible interval in each phase, which may suggest considerable variability within the data, their 0.50 credible interval greatly surpasses the overall mean. During the late Roman period, the HDI fluctuates between 0.59-0.73. In the early medieval period, the HDI is marginally lower, ranging between 0.55-0.64, before increasing again in the 11th century samples, where it ranges between 0.64-0.76.\nFor what concerns the two primary cash crops, grapes and olives, it is challenging to draw conclusions with regards to site type and chronology as predictors. This is due to the small group sizes and variability between sites, which result in particularly broad credible intervals. In general, there are indications of a decrease in grape cultivation in both urban and rural areas. In the rural setting, however, the trend is fluctuating, with a positive turn in the late Roman era and a new decline in the early Middle Ages. With such wide credible intervals covering a significant portion of the probability space, it is probable that the data was unable to overcome the prior, leading to high uncertainty. Further data or a more informative prior (although this may introduce subjectivity) may be necessary. The olive plots have narrowed the credible intervals range slightly. During the Roman period, olives were frequently present in urban sites with a range of 0.63-0.72 (credible interval = 0.50) and religious sites with a highest density interval ranging between 0.61 and 0.81. In rural sites, olives were also prevalent, with an estimated mean of around 0.50 in the Roman period and 0.52 in the late Roman period. However, in later periods, there was a sharp decline in olive production. This decline commences in the late Roman period for both urban and rural villa sites, though the latter does experience a renewed positive HDI in the early medieval period. Generally, the average occurrence of grapes (although with all the limitations imposed by such large credible intervals) is higher than that of olives. This may be attributed to numerous samples in the database coming from northern Italy, which is less suitable for olive cultivation. The credible interval ranges for the models of nuts, i.e. hazelnuts, walnuts and chestnuts, are narrower and more informative compared to those of the grape/olives models. This implies that there is less variability in the dataset available for this category. During the Roman period, the highest HDIs for nuts are found in religious sites, necropoleis, and rural villas. However, the credible intervals for these categories are large. The estimated mean HDI for urban sites during this period is approximately 0.35, while for rural sites, it is around 0.22. During all the subsequent periods, the mean predicted occurrence remains below the overall mean of 0.31 for both types of locations, with a potential downward trend for urban sites.\nThe group that exhibits the most significant decline is rural villas, which decreased from an average Roman estimate of 0.45 to an average of 0.09 in the early medieval era. Villas show a similar decrease in the frequency of domestic fruits (apple, fig, melon, peach, pear, plum, date), but with credible intervals of considerable size.\nDuring the Roman era, fruits were abundant in urban locations, becoming less prevalent in subsequent periods, only to rise again in samples after the 11th century. Funerary sites also exhibit high HDI averages for domestic fruits (0.23 in the Roman period and 0.28 in the late Roman period). In contrast, there is a gradual rise in the occurrence of cultivated fruits in rural areas between the Roman and medieval eras. In addition to larger fruits, our model encompasses the consumption of different types of berries and other less common fruits such as sour cherry, cornelian cherry, wild cherries, elderberry, blackthorn, blackberry, and strawberry. It appears that the presence of these fruits was ubiquitous, albeit in minor quantities. Upon closer inspection of contexts with more reliable credible intervals, a positive trend is observable in rural sites from the Roman to the medieval era. While urban sites exhibit fluctuations, they appear to have a higher consumption of berries, with HDI values exceeding the overall mean. The trend in rural villas is less pronounced: during the Roman period there is a substantial variability that resulted in a larger credible interval, whereas the late Roman period’s average is around the overall mean of 0.10. Afterwards, the average drops to 0.04. For the Roman and late Roman period, estimated averages of 0.04 and 0.07 are identified in necropoleis, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Noble grains (wheat and barley).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Minor grains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Legumes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Grape.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(e) Olives.

Credible intervals are provided.\n\n\n\n7.3.1 Species richness in urban contexts\nIn addition to examining the predicted occurrence of particular plant species within the selected contextual classifications, we found it instructive to examine plant richness. Yet, as previously stated in this chapter, subsetting data based on site type results in very narrow groups that provide unreliable information. Of all the context categories, urban sites displayed the greatest frequency of sites for every chronology analysed. For this reason, and because of our specific interest in the early medieval urban garden phenomenon, we calculated the richness of plants in urban settings for each stage. To ensure accuracy, we excluded contexts that did not report all three types of plant taxa under examination - namely cereals, fruits/nuts, and legumes. This correction carries significant drawbacks because it eliminates sites where the exclusion of certain plant categories may have been intentional (such as storages). However, despite considerable fluctuations in the numbers (particularly for the 11th century CE, which comprises only two samples after the correction), the overall trend remains similar to the previous one. Plant richness slightly decreases in urban contexts after the Roman period; however, early medieval cities exhibit a higher plant richness than the Roman and late Roman phases. In the 11th century, plant richness increases even further.\n\n\nTable 7.1: Plant richness in urban contexts before and after (*) removing incomplete assemblages.\n\n\nChronology\nRichness\nSamples\nRichness*\nSamples*\n\n\n\n\nR\n6.5\n44\n8.45\n22\n\n\nLR\n5.9\n24\n7.2\n10\n\n\nEMA\n7.2\n25\n9.6\n8\n\n\nMa\n9\n8\n17.5\n2"

    "text": "7.4 Macroregion\n\n7.4.1 Cereals\nThe central focus of this chapter revolves around cereals, given their pivotal economic importance during the first millennium CE. The exploration begins with two Bayesian models that vividly depict the estimated occurrence of free-threshing wheats, barley, and other more rustic grains across each chronological phase under consideration. Moving forward, our attention shifts to the richness of cereals within each sub-region. We delve into an examination of the distances between the northern and southern Italian cereal datasets during the early Middle Ages, presented as a compelling case study. Unlike the Bayesian models, this case study employs a frequentist approach, allowing for a comparative analysis of results obtained through distinct methodologies and perspectives. As we unravel the findings, it becomes evident that both the Bayesian models and the frequentist approach converge on the same conclusions. Despite their differing methodologies and analytical angles, the unified outcomes contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics surrounding cereal cultivation in northern and southern Italy during the early Middle Ages.\n\n7.4.1.1 Free-threshing wheats and barley\nIn addition to considering chronological and context type models, another important variable that has been examined in this study is Macroregion. This allows us to divide the Italian peninsula into three regions (southern, central, and northern) and investigate more specific geographic questions. Due to the limited amount of data available, it is not however feasible to build on the previous model and incorporate this variable into the analysis. Additionally, including three categorical predictors would make it difficult to interpret the results. To account for the influence of Macroregion, we can stratify the dataset by southern, central, and northern Italy, similar to how we stratified by Site_Type. It is important to also consider chronological stratification as different dynamics were occurring in the areas under observation. Therefore, we can block by Chronology and stratify by Macroregion to investigate the influence of geographic location on animal husbandry and consumption patterns.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.13: The DAG that represents the relationship between Chronology, Macroregion, and the presence of plants in the study. Chronology is shown as a collider variable, and its influence on NISP is mediated through Macroregion. To block the backdoor path between Chronology and Plant_Present, the dataset is stratified by Chronology.\n\n\n\n\nThe chosen distribution is a Binomial where \\(F\\) (short for ‘found’) on the left side of the formula is the outcome variable—a presence/absence indicator for the observation \\(i\\). In the case of a single taxon, the value can either be 0 (for absence) or 1 (for presence) and the \\(T\\) is 1 (i.e. Bernoulli distribution). If the model is for more than a single taxon, the \\(T\\) is the total number of taxa that are being modelled. The model presented below is an intercept-only model, where the intercept \\(\\alpha\\) carries an interaction index \\({[REGid]}\\) as the model will provide estimates for each macroregion and chronology under examination. For instance, Roman: southern Italy is labelled as 1, Roman: central Italy as 2, and so forth.\n\\[\nF_{i} \\sim Binomial(T, \\bar{p}_{i} )\n\\]\n\\[\nlogit(\\bar{p}_{i}) = \\alpha_{[REGid]}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\alpha_{[REGid]} \\sim Normal(0,1.5)\n\\]\nWhile cereals are particularly important in our analysis, the interpretation of the results of this model is problematic and immediately reveals the group imbalances. The credible intervals for northern Italy are narrow and informative, considering the usage of a weakly informative prior. On the other hand, the range of estimates for southern and central Italy requires careful consideration. Nonetheless, it is still possible to draw conclusions by analysing the regions of the graphs where the majority of the probability estimates are located. During the Roman period, the mean estimated probabilities of discovering free-threshing wheats and barley was similar in all three sub-regions (SI = 0.48, CI = 0.50, NI = 0.46), although the credible interval for central Italy is quite large requiring additional archaeobotanical data to increase specificity. In the late Roman period, the credible intervals are quite large both for southern Italy (where the 0.50 probability region ranges between 0.38 and 0.52) and central Italy (where the 0.50 probability region ranges between 0.53 and 0.69). Conversely, the 0.50 credible interval for northern Italy is between 0.55 and 0.62. During the early medieval period, there was a marked increase in estimates across all three regions. Central Italy had the highest peak, ranging from 0.91 to 0.97, while northern Italy reached 0.78 to 0.84, and southern Italy attained 0.67 to 0.77. The smaller post-11th century dataset yields broad credible intervals, suggesting a possible positive growth in southern Italy, while mean estimates for central and northern Italy reflect a minor decrease.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.14: Bayesian probability estimates for free-threshing wheats and barley, divided by macroregion and chronology. The prediction estimates are produced with a GLM and weakly informative priors. Credible intervals are provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4.1.2 ‘Minor’ grains\nThe model for ‘minor’ grains (emmer, einkorn, foxtail millet, broomcorn millet, rye, sorghum) in the Italian macroregion uses a Binomial distribution where \\(F\\) (short for ‘found’) on the left side of the formula is the outcome variable—a presence/absence indicator for the observation \\(i\\). As there are seven types of ‘minor’ grains under investigation, the binomial will take 7 as maximum (\\(T\\)). This model effectively shows the probability of a single site to be reliant on more rustic grains. Emmer for instance, is ubiquitous in Italy, but in many cases it is the only hulled grain found among other cereals in a context. The presence of other cereals on a site can in fact be useful in understanding the local rural economy. The model presented below is an intercept-only model, where the intercept \\(\\alpha\\) carries an interaction index \\({[REGid]}\\) as the model will provide estimates for each macroregion and chronology under examination.\n\\[\nF_{i} \\sim Binomial(7, \\bar{p}_{i} )\n\\]\n\\[\nlogit(\\bar{p}_{i}) = \\alpha_{[REGid]}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\alpha_{[REGid]} \\sim Normal(0,1.5)\n\\] After examining the posterior distribution, the credible intervals reveal a striking coherence in the dataset, marked by a lack of excessive dispersion. However, central Italy deviates as the group sizes are small, which leads to larger credible intervals. Divergent patterns among Italian sub-regions can already be observed in the Roman age. In southern Italy, the 0.50 HDI is confined within the tight range of 0.18 to 0.21. Contrastingly, central Italy showcases a broader span from 0.07 to 0.13, while the North falls within the range of 0.22 to 0.24. In particular, the North has a considerably short credible interval, suggesting consistency and a substantial volume of observations. We observe diverging trends as we transition into the late Roman period. Southern Italy maintains a narrow range of 0.08-0.12, whereas central Italy experiences a higher degree of variance from 0.17 to 0.23. The north shifts towards ‘minor’ grains, reflected in an expanded interval of 0.31-0.35. During the early Middle Ages, both central and northern Italy surpass the overall mean of 0.23, with HDIs ranging between 0.46-0.54 and 0.44-0.48, respectively. A growing disparity between these regions and southern Italy becomes evident, where the HDI hovers between 0.13-0.17. Despite the broad credible intervals for post-11th-century samples, the estimated means consistently uphold the preceding trends, albeit with a subtle downward tendency.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.15: Bayesian probability estimates for ‘minor’ grains (emmer, einkorn, foxtail and broomcorn millets, Sorghum), divided by macroregion and chronology. The prediction estimates are produced with a GLM and weakly informative priors. Credible intervals are provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4.1.3 Cereal richness in the Italian macroregions\nIn Section 6.3.4, detailed insights into the pre-processing of archaeobotanical data were provided, aiming to enhance the accuracy of cereal richness estimates across the three distinct Italian sub-regions. The original group sizes before this pre-processing are illustrated in Table 7.2, while Table 7.3 displays the reduced number of samples following the data processing steps. For a more granular view of the impact of data processing, Table 7.4 presents the effective count of caryopses per group, with the mean richness conveniently summarised in Table 7.5. Examining cereal presence values reveals similarities between Roman northern and southern Italian sites. Notably, central Italy reports higher values, albeit caution is warranted as this observation relies on data from only three sites, rendering it less reliable. Transitioning to the early Middle Ages, central Italy emerges once again as the region richest in cereals, closely trailed by northern Italy. A particularly interesting observation is the continuing similarity of cereal values in southern Italy, which remain remarkably close to those recorded in Roman times. For a comprehensive listing of southern Italian early Middle Ages sites, refer to Table 7.6.\n\n\n\n\nTable 7.2: Sample sizes before pre-processing.\n\n\nChronology\nNorthern Italy\nCentral Italy\nSouthern Italy\n\n\n\n\nRoman\n43\n5\n35\n\n\nLate Roman\n46\n8\n10\n\n\nEarly Medieval\n42\n10\n17\n\n\n11th c.\n12\n4\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 7.3: Effective sample sizes.\n\n\nChronology\nNorthern Italy\nCentral Italy\nSouthern Italy\n\n\n\n\nRoman\n36\n3\n27\n\n\nLate Roman\n42\n5\n5\n\n\nEarly Medieval\n39\n10\n13\n\n\n11th c.\n12\n4\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 7.4: Effective cereal caryopses count for each chronology and macroregion.

Given the non-unimodal nature of the data and the use of presence/absence analysis, a robust choice is the application of a non-parametric test, such as PERMANOVA, on the early medieval botanical dataset. Before subjecting the data to the PERMANOVA analysis, we pre-processed it as outlined in Section 6.3.4. To establish a baseline for comparison, the same PERMANOVA procedure was applied to the Roman dataset.\nThe code snippet provided below demonstrates the utilisation of the adonis2() function to perform the PERMANOVA calculation:\n\n# Example of how to use the function adonis()\n1set.seed(29)\n\nPermanova.Cereals.R = adonis2(\n2  Bot_PA_data.R ~ Macroregion,\n  data = Bot_PA_categ.R,\n3  permutations = 10000,\n4  method=\"jaccard\"\n)\n\n\n1\n\nIn order to get the same results, we set a seed.\n\n2\n\nFormula specification.\n\n3\n\nNumber of random permutations.\n\n4\n\nDistance metric.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 7.7: Results of the PERMANOVA for the Roman and Early Medieval phases.\n\n\nPhase\nR2\np-value\n\n\n\n\nRoman\n0.03\n0.0977902\n\n\nEarly Medieval\n0.10\n0.0001000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPERMANOVA analysis was performed on the Roman dataset using the variable Macroregion, indicating a lack of statistical significance in the calculated p-value, implying homogeneity in the dataset. However, the early medieval dataset showed highly significant results (0&lt;p&lt;0.001) with 99.99% confidence. Due to insufficient samples from southern Italy, PERMANOVA was not conducted on the late Roman dataset. To verify the statistical significance of the PERMANOVA outcomes obtained using the EMA dataset, it is critical to ensure that the underlying assumptions are fulfilled, especially given our small group sizes. We first examine the homogeneity of variances, determining the distances between group samples and centroids using the betadisper() function in the vegan package. If the variance is consistent, we accept the null hypothesis of no variation in dispersion between groups. To assess variance, we can employ analysis of variance (ANOVA).\n\n\n\n\nTable 7.8: Group distances from centroids.\n\n\nPhase\nNorthern Italy\nSouthern Italy\n\n\n\n\nRoman\n0.53\n0.48\n\n\nEarly Medieval\n0.37\n0.38\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 7.9: p-values of the ANOVA on the betadisper for the Roman and Early Medieval phases.\n\n\nPhase\np-value\n\n\n\n\nRoman\n0.1892284\n\n\nEarly Medieval\n0.9374030\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Roman - Groups and distances to centroids on the first two PCoA axes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Roman - Boxplots of distances to centroids.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) early Medieval - Groups and distances to centroids on the first two PCoA axes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) early Medieval - Boxplots of distances to centroids.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.16: Results of the betadisper() on the Roman and Early Medieval datasets.\n\n\nThe graphical representation through betadisper() plots (Figure 7.16) illustrates a comparable distance from centroids for both northern Italy and southern Italy categories. Complementing this visual analysis, the ANOVA on betadisper() affirms the lack of significance (p-value exceeding the threshold), indicating homogeneity in group dispersions (Table 7.9). This robust statistical foundation leads us to confidently affirm the results obtained from the PERMANOVA analysis, supporting the conclusion that there is a significant difference between the two groups of sites—southern and northern Italy—specifically in the realm of cereal farming during the early Middle Ages.\nConversely, when the same tests were applied to Roman sites, the outcomes failed to delineate a significant separation between the two groups. This corroborates the notion that, during the Roman age, there was not a noteworthy difference in the types of cereals cultivated between northern and southern Italy.\n\n\n7.4.1.5 Quantifying the separation: nMDS\nIn the investigation of the northern and southern Italian early medieval cereals dataset (Section 7.4.1.4), an additional approach involves quantifying the distance between groups of sites for both the Roman and early Middle Ages. For this purpose, the chosen dimensionality reduction algorithm is the non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) available in the vegan library for R. A detailed explanation of this algorithm is provided in Section 6.3.3.2.1. The code snippet below exemplifies the utilisation of the metaMDS() function to perform the nMDS.\n\n1set.seed(29)\n\n2nMDS &lt;- metaMDS(Dataset,\n3                   k=1,\n4                   distance = \"jaccard\")\n\n\n1\n\nWe set a seed as these computations are random.\n\n2\n\nDataframe on which to perform the nMDS.\n\n3\n\nSet the number of dimensions to 1.\n\n4\n\nDistance metric.\n\n\n\n\nTo ensure the integrity of computations and avoid potential fallacies, the macroregion central Italy and the chronologies LR (late Roman) and Ma (11th century onwards) have been excluded from this analysis. This cautious approach is taken due to the uneven distribution of the group of samples. The nMDS has reduced the cereal dataset to a single dimension, both for effective visualisation of the results with KDE plots and to facilitate distance calculations. In Figure 7.17 (a), the nMDS results for the Roman cereals presence/absence dataset are presented. As previously highlighted, the non-significant outcome of the PERMANOVA aligns with the shorter Wasserstein distance, as calculated using the wasserstein1d() function from the transport library. Both chronologies exhibit an overlap in the curves, with the Roman age displaying a more substantial overlap, indicative of higher similarity within the group of assemblages. The EMA groups’ overlap (Figure 7.17, b) can be attributed to the fact that the presence of free-threshing wheats and barley is not exclusive to southern Italian sites; these grains are prevalent in the north as well. The key distinction lies in the south, where ‘noble’ grains are not cultivated in tandem with other grains. The graph for the EMA chronology reveals a clearer separation of macroregional groups, with minor overlaps. Additionally, the graph highlights variability in the northern Italian dataset, a characteristic further underscored by outliers in the boxplots in Figure 7.17.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Roman - KDE curves of the nMDS.

We will not go into the technical details of constructing this multi-level model, as the methodology is the same as that described above for cereals, using identical predictors and priors. A clear trend is illustrated in the accompanying figure (Figure 7.19).\nNorthern Italy consistently shows the most reliable credible intervals in each chronology, with southern Italy (except for the 11th century samples) following closely. Conversely, central Italy has wider ranges, indicating greater uncertainty in the estimates. From the Roman period (mean = 0.15) to the early medieval and medieval periods (means = 0.30/0.29), the estimated means increase in the north. From the Roman (mean = 0.24) to the late Roman (mean = 0.09) period, there is a marked decrease in southern Italy, followed by an increase during the early medieval (mean = 0.23) and medieval periods (mean = 0.37, but with an HDI varying between 0.29 and 0.46). Similarly, the central Italian area shows a steady increase in the cultivation of legumes, with a mean of 0.19 in the Roman phase and peaking at 0.60 in the 11th century samples (but with a credible interval of 0.50 ranging from 0.55-0.66). The importance of legumes in this sub-region aligns with expectations, considering the hilly landscape and the historical agricultural focus of this area.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.19: Bayesian probability estimates for legumes, stratified by macroregion and chronology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4.3 Fruits\nBinomial models have been systematically developed for a number of fruit categories, following the same methodological approach as other macro-regional models and using the same priors. The specific formulae of the models are not repeated here, but they follow the established methodology.\nThe results for the two main cash crops, grapes and olives, are of particular interest. The analysis shows considerable variability in the results for these crops, indicating a degree of uncertainty in the estimates. The scope of our investigation is not limited to marketable crops, as we have also assessed the diversity of wild and domestic fruits and nuts, providing an in-depth study of heterogeneous fruit categories in different Italian sub-regions and over different time periods. #### Grape\nThe models assessing the occurrence of grapes exhibit notable dispersion, leading to large credible intervals. Basing our interpretation on the 0.50 HDIs, in the Roman period, grapes were markedly more prevalent in the southern regions (0.76-0.85), aligning with expectations given their warmer climates and longstanding tradition of grape cultivation. Central Italy also displayed widespread cultivation, albeit with a larger interval (0.61-0.82). The north showed a notable presence as well, with an HDI ranging between 0.62-0.72. However, in the late Roman period, credible intervals expanded significantly, especially in southern and central Italy. In the south, there was a substantial decrease in the HDI ranges, ranging between 0.32 and 0.50. Contrastingly, central Italy displayed a HDI in a higher probability range, spanning between 0.72-0.86. In the north, the range remained similar to the previous phase, with an estimated mean around the overall mean of 0.65.\nTransitioning to the early medieval phase, the occurrence of grapes experienced a renewed increase in the south (range: 0.50-0.65). However, central Italy and the north witnessed a decline in their HDIs. Particularly in northern Italian assemblages, the estimated mean (0.60) dropped below the Roman maximum of 0.66. Notably, the north demonstrated minimal variation in means across the four phases, with the 11th-century samples returning a mean of 0.65. In southern and central Italy, broad credible intervals limit the provision of valuable information.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.20: Bayesian probability estimates for grape, divided by macroregion and chronology. The prediction estimates are produced with a GLM and weakly informative priors. Credible intervals are provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4.3.1 Olives\nAs with grapes, the models for olive occurrence show credible intervals of considerable size, which presents a challenge to reliable interpretation. When the 0.50 HDIs are used to gain insight, discernible trends emerge. In particular, there is a marked difference between the south and the north of Italy, which is mainly due to climatic factors, as will be explained in more detail in the following models in this chapter. In the Roman period, the HDI for the south lies between 0.83 and 0.90, underlining the strong presence of olives. In contrast, the north has a much lower HDI of 0.30-0.40, reflecting less widespread cultivation. The paucity of sites in Roman central Italy results in a wide 0.50 HDI (0.46-0.70), and the 0.99 HDI for this region is exceptionally scattered (0.12-0.91), making it unreliable. During the late Roman period, the HDIs remain wide, especially for the southern (0.59-0.77) and central (0.50-0.71) regions. However, in the North, the range tightens to 0.19-0.25, suggesting a more consistent pattern. As we approach the early medieval period, the presence of olives diminishes in all regions, with the HDI ranging from 0.50-0.65 in the south, 0.17-0.31 in the centre and 0.05-0.1 in the north, where the dataset is more coherent and substantial. The falling continues in the samples after the 11th century, although this period shows increased variability between sites.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.21: Bayesian probability estimates for olive, divided by macroregion and chronology. The prediction estimates are produced with a GLM and weakly informative priors. Credible intervals are provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4.3.2 Nuts\nThe examination of archaeobotanical remains of nuts reveals minimal variations across regions and chronological phases. During the Roman period, nuts were estimated to occur in the southern regions at a frequency of between 0.14 and 0.19. However, interpreting the data for central Italy is challenging due to a large credible interval. In the highest density region, the estimated frequency ranges from 0.11 to 0.26, indicating substantial uncertainty in the estimates. In the northern regions, the estimated occurrence is relatively narrower, ranging from 0.24 to 0.30.\nDuring the late Roman period, the presence of nuts declines in the southern regions, with the estimated range dropping to between 0.03 and 0.06. In central Italy, a broad credible interval persists, ranging from 0.17 to 0.28. Meanwhile, the estimated range in the northern regions remains similar to that observed in the Roman phase, hovering between 0.25 and 0.30.\nIn the early medieval period, nuts continued to be present in the south, maintaining a level of consistency similar to that of the late Roman phase. In central Italy, the estimated range shifts to 0.11 to 0.19. Northern Italy reports an estimated range of 0.19 to 0.24, suggesting a slight fluctuation.\nThe southern and central regions have very large credible intervals in the 11th century, rendering the estimates less reliable. However, the estimated mean closely aligns with the overall mean of 0.15 in both regions. In contrast, the north reports an estimated range of 0.14 to 0.23, indicating a continued presence of nuts during this period.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.22: Bayesian probability estimates for nuts, divided by macroregion and chronology. The prediction estimates are produced with a GLM and weakly informative priors. Credible intervals are provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4.3.3 Domestic and wild fruits\nThe model for domestic fruit occurrence outperformed previous fruit models. During the Roman period in southern Italy, the probability of domestic fruit presence ranged from 0.19 to 0.24 with a 0.50 credible interval. In Roman central Italy, estimates suggest a more modest presence of domestic fruit, ranging from 0.03 to 0.07.\nIn the late Roman era, domestic fruit occurrence declined in the southern regions, estimated to be between 0.04 and 0.07. However, there was a mild improvement in domestic fruit presence in the late Roman centre, estimated to range from 0.05 to 0.09. The north sustained a similar range as the previous phase, which was between 0.14-0.16.\nIn the early medieval period, the southern regions continue to show the presence of domestic fruit, ranging from 0.06 to 0.09. The early medieval centre shows a similar presence, with estimates ranging from 0.04 to 0.07. In the northern region, the presence of domestic fruit is reported, with estimates ranging from 0.12 to 0.14. Until the 11th century, the south maintains its presence of domestic fruit, estimated between 0.07 and 0.17. In central Italy there is also a continued presence, with estimates between 0.09 and 0.17. In the north, a significant presence of domestic fruit is observed, with estimates ranging from 0.20 to 0.26. It is worth noting that the higher HDIs in this phase are due to a smaller number of observations, thereby introducing increased uncertainty.\nThe model for less commonly domesticated and (mainly) wild fruits shows a low dietary impact of these fruits during the 1st millennium CE. There is a noticeable trend, with southern and central Italy showing lower HDIs, falling below the mean of 0.07 from the Roman to the early medieval period. Reliable results, attributed to tighter HDIs, show a consistent range between 0.09 and 0.16. The small presence observed in this area is in contrast to the consumption pattern observed in northern Italy. Upon further investigation into the 11th century, a clear increase in the presence of berries can be seen across all sub-regions. In the south, HDIs increase from 0.03 to 0.09, reflecting a higher density of findings of less commonly domesticated fruits. Central Italy shows an increase in the prevalence of these fruits, reaching HDI values between 0.07 and 0.14. In contrast, northern Italy experiences the largest growth, with HDI values peaking between 0.27 and 0.34, indicative of a substantial rise in the utilisation of berries and other fruits during this period.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.23: Bayesian probability estimates for common fruits, divided by macroregion and chronology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.24: Bayesian probability estimates for less commonly domesticated fruits, stratified by macroregion and chronology."

    "text": "7.5 Altitude\nThe probability of the occurrence of the most prevalent cereal remains can be modelled against site elevation in the four time periods examined. The distribution of archaeobotanical remains across sites is uneven. During the Roman age, the majority of investigated sites are situated between 0 and 100 MSL. However, there is a rise in the number of sites at higher elevations in the subsequent phases. Though this may indicate a change in settlement patterns, it is not the focus of this study. Nonetheless, mapping the distribution of sites according to elevation could yield valuable information. Due to the time consuming nature of the process, it was not possible to produce elevation models for all the plants surveyed. Therefore, we selected only those plants that showed susceptibility to altitude-based positive or negative effects or were economically significant. Cereal crops were given priority. As not all cereals are suitable for cultivation at high altitudes, it was considered more appropriate to model them independently instead of categorising them into ‘noble’ and ‘minor’ grains. For reference, the breakdown of site elevations studied during the four chronologies can be found in Figure 7.25.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.25: Distribution of sites at different elevations. The site density has been scaled to facilitate comparison between phases.\n\n\n\n\n\n7.5.1 Model specification and priors\nIn the previous models, an interaction index was used because we were dealing with categorical variables. In this scenario, however, we have a categorical and numerical variable, as we are focusing on the effect of altitude on the presence of plants. The DAG for this case still shows Chronology as a collider, similar to the previous situation. Certainly the time period affects both the likelihood of a plant being present and the altitude of the sites. As shown in Figure 7.25, the distribution of sites varies between different chronological phases. We cannot be certain whether this trend in the data represent real settlement patterns, but for the purposes of this study we need to adjust by Chronology.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.26: The DAG that represents the relationship between Chronology, Altitude, and the presence of plants in the study. Chronology is shown as a collider variable, and its influence on NISP is mediated through Altitude. To block the backdoor path between Chronology and Plant_Present, the dataset is stratified by Chronology.\n\n\n\n\nCreating a Bayesian multi-level model to predict the presence of a particular cereal taxon at different elevations is comparable to the binomial models discussed earlier. Since we are only modelling individual taxa, we are dealing with a Bernoulli distribution (in which the number of trials is fixed at 1). Furthermore, we intend to stratify the models by chronology, just as we did previously. For this purpose, we introduce two parameters: a varying intercept \\(\\alpha\\) that carries the chronology index \\({[ChrID]}\\) (i.e. Roman = 1, late Roman = 2, etc.), and a slope \\(\\beta\\) that is multiplied by the elevation of the \\(i\\)-th site \\(Alt_{i}\\). The slope parameter is included to ensure that a change in elevation is reflected in the predicted probability. Both parameters have a weakly informative prior (with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.5) introduced to make the possible outcomes (present/absent) equally likely in the absence of data. The prior predictive simulation in Figure 7.27 visually demonstrates the effect of these priors, with probabilities piling up on both 0 and 1.\nThe figures can be interpreted in a comparable manner to the previous ones, which did not incorporate numerical predictors. The x-axis displays elevation expressed in kilometers, while the y-axis presents the probability of discovering a distinct cereal. Similar to previous plots, estimates can be identified across various credible intervals, where wider intervals convey greater uncertainty in the estimation (owing to limited sample sizes or prominent variability in the data observed). For example, it is evident from each plot that the credible interval widens with increasing elevation. In fact, most of the sites examined in Figure 7.25 are situated at lower elevations. The 0.50 HDI, which provides the most reliable probability range, is represented by the darkest shade in the middle of the curves. The following formula shows the components of this model, where the mean probability \\(p_{i}\\) is modelled by a logit link:\n\\[\nP_{i} \\sim Bernoulli(\\bar{p}_{i})\n\\]\n\\[\nlogit(\\bar{p}_{i}) = \\alpha_{[ChrID]} + \\beta_{[ChrID]}\\cdot Alt_{i}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\alpha_{ChrID} \\sim Normal(0,1.5)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\beta_{ChrID} \\sim Normal(0,1.5)\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.27: Prior predictive simulation for the altitude models used in this section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.5.2 Cereals\nAs planned, we concentrated on modelling the presence of particular types of cereals at varying elevations and chronological phases. This decision was influenced by our interest in economically significant plants and the fact that certain cereal species, such as rye, are more resilient to low temperatures. This makes elevation a crucial factor in farming strategies. The models are classified based on chronology and varying elevations, while acknowledging the significance of certain cultural factors such as geographical area and context type. However, these are not taken into account as having an excessive number of subsets with a relatively small dataset poses a risk. Therefore, we can examine the estimated patterns throughout the entire peninsula.\nFree-threshing wheats, which are likely the most cultivated cereals in Italy, demonstrate a robust presence in all four chronological phases at any altitude, with the likelihood of their occurrence gradually increasing towards the early Middle Ages. It is evident that there is no noticeable trend in the prediction curve, and there appears to be no correlation between site elevation and this cereal taxon. Whether it was cultivated everywhere or imported, it is impossible to determine with this dataset. However, the mere presence of this information remains significant. On the contrary, barley shows more pronounced patterns than free-threshing wheats. During the Roman period, and particularly in the late Roman era, there is a notable correlation between the presence of barley and a heightened elevation quota. If the estimated occurrence at sea level is approximately 0.4 (which is still a significant contribution), at around 1100-1200 MSL the prediction increases to a probability of 0.90. This correlation appears to remain strong during the early medieval period, with probabilities ranging from 0.70 (at sea level) to 1. The high probabilities also reflect the significance of this cereal in early medieval agriculture.\nConversely, in the assemblages after the 11th century, the curve seems to be flat, suggesting no correlation and exhibiting greater uncertainty in the data. Additionally, the small number of assemblages for this phase is apparent in the graph, which terminates predictions at approximately 450 MSL due to a lack of available data beyond that altitude (refer to Figure 7.25).\nThere is a chronological shift evident in the estimated probabilities for emmer, although during the Roman and late Roman periods there is higher uncertainty due to wide HDIs, particularly at high elevations. The estimated means during these two phases imply no correlation, however their credible intervals allow for the possibility of positive or negative trends at higher elevations. In the early Middle Ages, the correlation between the increase in more rustic grains (particularly in the North where some sites are located at higher elevations, see Figure 3.8) and a higher probability of discovering emmer appears to be positive. The correlation remains only marginally positive in the subsequent phase. However, as previously mentioned, the model ceases predictions at 450 MSL.\nSimilarly to emmer, the posterior predictive simulations for einkorn display significant ambiguity at any stage, particularly beyond 300 MSL. During the Roman period, emmer seems to have been present at greater frequencies in higher altitude sites, while the curves remain flat in subsequent phases, as indicated by the 0.50 HDI. The only visible change is the higher probabilities in the early medieval era.\nThe model for rye produced some interesting results. During the Roman era, the chances of discovering rye on a particular site are minimal, with a slightly higher likelihood at greater elevations. In the later Roman period, the likelihood of identification even at sea level rises, displaying an upward trend on sites located at high elevations, albeit accompanied by greater ambiguity (owing to the limited number of locations at high altitudes). During the early medieval period, rye was found to have a higher probability of growth at sea level with a strong positive correlation to higher altitudes, where it became more established. The correlation was observed to be flat in post-11th century samples. However, this data is unreliable as the HDI values are very large and should not be considered.\nIt is more challenging to identify potential patterns in the graph of broomcorn and foxtail millets beyond the Roman phase. In the Roman era, millets were more likely to be found at sea level, with a mean probability of 0.35 and a 0.50 HDI indicating a 0.10-0.25 probability around 1200 MSL. While this particular phase shows a slightly negative trend, the overall probabilities of discovering millets increase in subsequent phases without any apparent correlation to altitude. Only in the post-11th century samples, where the HDI is high, does the negative trend re-emerge.\nRegarding the final cereal evaluated, sorghum, its presence during the Roman and late Roman periods is scarce, making it difficult to establish any correlation. During the early medieval period, its presence increases and, at sea level, the mean probability is approximately 0.20; however, this probability lessens as altitude increases (having an absolute low of 0 at 1200 MSL). Sorghum is more prevalent in 11th-century samples (mean = 0.40), nevertheless, uncertainty remains high. Although there are wide credible intervals, this phase still indicates a negative correlation. The uncertainty primarily stems from the small sample size rather than the variability in the observed data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Free-Threshing Wheats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Barley.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Emmer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Einkorn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(e) Rye.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(f) Foxtail and Broomcorn millet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(g) Sorghum.\n\n\n\nFigure 7.28: Posterior distribution plots showing the presence of cereals in relation to different altitudes and stratified by chronological phase.\n\n\n\n7.5.2.1 Community plot\nUpon evaluating the impact of elevation changes on each taxon, their posterior distributions have been plotted together on a graph. The x-axis, representing the inverse logit probability of occurrence, provides a user-friendly interpretation within the confines of a standard probability space bounded between 0 and 1. On the other hand, the y-axis displays the estimated slope parameter (\\(\\beta\\)), a varying parameter of our model that has been multiplied with the altitude of each site. This graphical representation not only aids in visualising our findings but also facilitates the comprehensive evaluation of cereals presence. This approach allows us to assess positive or negative correlations within our graph. In addition, the graph highlights the considerable variability in estimating the probability of the presence of certain taxa, mirroring the broad HDIs observed in earlier plots. Figure 7.29 shows that the most significant correlations and variations occurred during the early medieval period. There is a clear positive correlation between higher sites and the presence of free-threshing wheat, barley, rye and emmer. In contrast, altitude shows a negative correlation with sorghum presence. When we move to medieval samples from the 11th century onwards, the picture becomes complex and characterised by high uncertainty: clusters of points hover both above and below 0.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.29: MCMC estimates for intercept and slope (the latter plotted in the logit scale). Negative slopes indicate a negative relationship between the plant occurrence and increasing altitude. Intercepts were kept as a baseline occurrence probability of the taxa. Taxa on the left of the graph are rarer, while taxa on the right are more common. It is important to notice that this graph represents the taxa response to elevation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.5.3 Legumes\nInstead of creating separate models for each type of legume, an individual model has been developed for several legumes since they can be grown under similar conditions. This model uses a Binomial distribution instead of a Bernoulli distribution, as the number of legumes under examination - lentil, pea, grass pea, chickpea (Cicer arietinum), and vetches (common vetch, fava bean, Vicia sp.) - is fixed at 7. The model was built using a formula similar to the previous:\n\\[\nF_{i} \\sim Binomial(7, \\bar{p}_{i} )\n\\]\n\\[\nlogit(\\bar{p}_{i}) = \\alpha_{[ChrID]} + \\beta_{[ChrID]}\\cdot Alt_{i}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\alpha_{ChrID} \\sim Normal(0,1.5)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\beta_{ChrID} \\sim Normal(0,1.5)\n\\]\nThe impact of altitude on the discovery of legumes appears to be mild, displaying a slight decreasing trend during the Roman era and a minor positive upturn in the late Roman and early medieval periods. Nonetheless, there is a more pronounced correlation in assemblages from the 11th century, albeit restricted to 450 MSL, which prevents comprehensive analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.30: Posterior distribution plots showing the presence of legumes in relation to different altitudes and stratified by chronological phase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.5.4 Grapes and olives\nThe altitude models for fruits have solely focused on grapes and olives, the two cash crops of interest. Negative correlations with altitude were observed in both models. For grapes, the probabilities at sea level are similar in the Roman and late Roman periods, exceeding 0.75. In subsequent phases, they fall slightly below 0.75. During the first two periods, the probabilities sharply decline upon reaching the 1200 MSL, while in the early medieval period the decrease is less intense. It is important to remind that these models only consider the presence of plant remains. It would be informative to observe the abundance of these remains at different elevations if a sufficiently robust dataset is available. The trend in the 11th century samples does not exhibit any correlation; however, the prediction only extends up to 450 metres above sea level, which would not significantly impede vine cultivation.\nSimilarly, the olive models shows a marked decrease in predicted probabilities at higher altitudes during the Roman and late Roman periods. The early medieval dataset still shows a negative correlation, but with a higher uncertainty. For grapes, the medieval samples show no correlations because there are no observations at high altitudes. In fact, olive trees can thrive within the range of altitudes offered by this chronological phase (0-450 MSL).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.31: Posterior distribution plots showing the presence of grapes in relation to different altitudes and stratified by chronological phase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.32: Posterior distribution plots showing the presence of olives in relation to different altitudes and stratified by chronological phase."

    "text": "7.6 Model comparisons\nIn the concluding remarks of Section 6.6.2, we emphasised the significance of model comparison when conducting Bayesian modelling. So far, categorical predictors have predominantly been employed in models to draw different causal inferences, but numerical predictors are also usually utilised to evaluate the extent to which a predictor’s presence improves the model’s fitness. Indeed, adding further predictors can result in overfitting, leading to certain metrics (such as WAIC, pWAIC, etc.) penalising models with more predictors when comparing them. Farms can accommodate various animals in various climatic conditions, but plants are more vulnerable to external factors. Therefore, in addition to altitude, we included predictors such as average yearly precipitation and temperature. Different models have been developed, with various combinations of predictors, following the common procedure of starting with one predictor and progressively adding more. The aim is to determine whether some variables are more effective in predicting the presence of specific plants than others. For example, we can investigate whether the presence of free-threshing wheats in the sites is influenced more by the yearly rainfall, temperature, or altitude. These figures were derived from 1 km spatial resolution rasters using contemporary climatic data (Fick and Hijmans, 2017). While climatic fluctuations existed during the first millennium (see Section 2.2.2), these models are among the most accurate datasets obtainable.\n\n7.6.1 Precipitation\nThe presence of crops in a particular region can be influenced by the amount of rainfall. Sorghum and millet are examples of drought-tolerant cereals, while olives are among the most drought-resistant fruits. The following case studies aim to investigate whether increased rainfall has an impact on the presence of certain plant species. In order to assess the effectiveness of this variable in explaining the presence of specific plant taxa in relation to altitude, our approach involved the construction of multi-level models. The first Bernoulli model incorporated a varying effect for each chronology, following the previously established practice of introducing an index \\([ChrID]\\) to the intercept \\(\\alpha\\). Additionally, we incorporated a varying slope \\(bPrecip\\)—also contingent on the index \\([ChrID]\\)—to capture the variability across different subsets. This slope is then multiplied by a constant \\(MeanAnnualPrecip_{i}\\), representing the standardised mean annual precipitation for each site. Both \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(bPrecip\\) were then assigned weak priors.\n\\[\nP_{i} \\sim Bernoulli(\\bar{p}_{i})\n\\]\n\\[\nlogit(\\bar{p}_{i}) = \\alpha_{[ChrID]} + bPrecip_{[ChrID]}\\cdot MeanAnnualPrecip_{i}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\alpha_{[ChrID]} \\sim Normal(0,1.3)\n\\]\n\\[\nbPrecip_{[ChrID]} \\sim Normal(0,1.3)\n\\]\nThe second model was previously introduced in the altitude section of this chapter, but is being presented again for comparison purposes. This model utilises site altitude \\(Alt_{i}\\) as its sole predictor, stratified by chronology:\n\\[\nP_{i} \\sim Bernoulli(\\bar{p}_{i})\n\\]\n\\[\nlogit(\\bar{p}_{i}) = \\alpha_{[ChrID]} + bAlt_{[ChrID]}\\cdot Alt_{i}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\alpha_{[ChrID]} \\sim Normal(0,1.3)\n\\]\n\\[\nbAlt_{[ChrID]} \\sim Normal(0,1.3)\n\\] We subsequently include both altitude and mean annual precipitation in a third model to examine whether the addition of both predictors enhances the fit significantly:\n\\[\nP_{i} \\sim Bernoulli(\\bar{p}_{i})\n\\]\n\\[\nlogit(\\bar{p}_{i}) = \\alpha_{[ChrID]} + bAlt_{[ChrID]}\\cdot Alt_{i} + bPrecip_{[ChrID]}\\cdot MeanAnnualPrecip_{i}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\alpha_{[ChrID]} \\sim Normal(0,1.3)\n\\]\n\\[\nbAlt_{[ChrID]} \\sim Normal(0,1.3)\n\\]\n\\[\nbPrecip_{[ChrID]} \\sim Normal(0,1.3)\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Single coefficient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Two coefficients.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.33: Prior predictive simulations were conducted for the precipitation models employed in this section. As in previous models, both scenarios (present or absent) are equally plausible.\n\n\nHowever, our findings suggest that including the average annual rainfall as a predictor did not have a significant impact on model fitness. When comparing the three models using the WAIC measure3, no significant difference was observed:\n\n\n                      WAIC    SE dWAIC  dSE pWAIC weight\nm_Cwheat_precip     274.78 12.76  0.00   NA  7.09   0.76\nm_CWheat_precip_alt 277.94 13.15  3.15 1.90  9.13   0.16\nm_CWheat_altitude   279.32 13.53  4.54 5.23  6.05   0.08\n\n\nAlthough we have only shown the free-threshing wheats models for simplicity, we have created models for various other plants, including non-cereal plants, and found no significant impact of mean annual precipitation on the model. It should be noted that our analysis employs presence/absence measures. While this variable may be beneficial in predicting crop output, it is not appropriate for this particular data conversion. As the disparities are negligible, selecting the optimal predictor is subjective and based on what we consider to be a more relevant factor in explaining historical agricultural phenomena. Therefore, we will rely on altitude.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Precipitation coefficients\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Altitude coefficients\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.34: Slope coefficients for the three models analysed are displayed. The numerical values indicate the chronological levels. Larger bars indicate greater credible intervals.\n\n\n\n\n7.6.2 Temperature\nIn contrast to the precipitation models, models that utilise the standardised mean annual temperatures as a predictor exhibited diverse results. For each plant that is known to be more vulnerable to extreme temperature conditions or valuable plants, three models were developed. The models’ specifications remain identical to those presented in the preceding section. The first model utilised temperature (\\(MeanAnnualTemp_{i}\\)) as the sole predictor, stratified by chronology (\\([ChrID]\\)):\n\\[\nP_{i} \\sim Bernoulli(\\bar{p}_{i})\n\\]\n\\[\nlogit(\\bar{p}_{i}) = \\alpha_{[ChrID]} + bTemp_{[ChrID]}\\cdot MeanAnnualTemp_{i}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\alpha_{[ChrID]} \\sim Normal(0,1.3)\n\\]\n\\[\nbTemp_{[ChrID]} \\sim Normal(0,1.3)\n\\]\nThe second model is the altitude model that we have already presented before, and is used as a baseline for comparison:\n\\[\nP_{i} \\sim Bernoulli(\\bar{p}_{i})\n\\]\n\\[\nlogit(\\bar{p}_{i}) = \\alpha_{[ChrID]} + bAlt_{[ChrID]}\\cdot Alt_{i}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\alpha_{[ChrID]} \\sim Normal(0,1.3)\n\\]\n\\[\nbAlt_{[ChrID]} \\sim Normal(0,1.3)\n\\] Finally, the last model uses two predictors (in addition to chronology), namely site elevation and standardised mean annual temperature:\n\\[\nP_{i} \\sim Bernoulli(\\bar{p}_{i})\n\\]\n\\[\nlogit(\\bar{p}_{i}) = \\alpha_{[ChrID]} + bAlt_{[ChrID]}\\cdot Alt_{i} + bTemp_{[ChrID]}\\cdot MeanAnnualTemp_{i}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\alpha_{ChrID} \\sim Normal(0,1.3)\n\\]\n\\[\nbAlt_{[ChrID]} \\sim Normal(0,1.3)\n\\]\n\\[\nbTemp_{[ChrID]} \\sim Normal(0,1.3)\n\\]\nGiven that the models are identical to those created for the precipitation variable, we do not reproduce the prior predictive simulations.\nThe investigation into models for free-threshing wheat, rye, legumes, and grape indicates that incorporating an additional predictor does not appear to be warranted. The current models for each of these crops adequately capture the relevant dynamics and trends associated with their respective occurrences.\n\n\n                           WAIC    SE dWAIC  dSE pWAIC weight\nm_Cwheat_temperature     278.63 14.34  0.00   NA  7.87   0.51\nm_CWheat_altitude        279.32 13.53  0.69 4.21  6.05   0.36\nm_CWheat_temperature_alt 281.44 14.70  2.80 0.84  9.51   0.13\n\n\n\n\n                        WAIC    SE dWAIC  dSE pWAIC weight\nm_Rye_temperature     229.92 18.08  0.00   NA  8.62   0.76\nm_Rye_temperature_alt 232.31 18.32  2.39 1.07 10.21   0.23\nm_Rye_altitude        240.41 16.10 10.49 9.15  5.99   0.00\n\n\n\n\n                            WAIC    SE dWAIC  dSE pWAIC weight\nm_Legumes_altitude        890.84 35.15  0.00   NA 14.51   0.84\nm_Legumes_temperature     894.49 35.14  3.65 7.65 16.01   0.14\nm_Legumes_temperature_alt 897.66 35.27  6.82 6.40 22.01   0.03\n\n\n\n\n                          WAIC    SE dWAIC  dSE pWAIC weight\nm_grape_altitude        272.71 11.88  0.00   NA  5.37   0.70\nm_Grape_temperature_alt 274.57 13.49  1.86 5.36  7.71   0.28\nm_Grape_temperature     279.76 13.69  7.05 7.10  6.39   0.02\n\n\nHowever, the results for olive are worth noting. After a thorough comparison of the three models, it is clear that the choice of a model that includes both temperature and site altitude as explanatory factors is advantageous, although the additional predictor is penalised. The superior fit of this model, compared to the other two, justifies a closer look at the predicted probability of olive occurrence in relation to standardised annual mean temperatures and site altitude (expressed in km). It is remarkable that in each chronology there is minimal dispersion within the 0.50 HDIs.\nThe temporal differences between these observations seem to remain stable until the 11^th century. It is interesting to note that locations with higher temperatures show a greater propensity to either consume or produce olives. On the contrary, sites located at higher altitudes show a lower probability of participating in the consumption or production of this specific crop.\n\n\n                          WAIC    SE dWAIC   dSE pWAIC weight\nm_Olive_temperature_alt 225.67 14.97  0.00    NA  6.39   0.63\nm_Olive_temperature     226.70 15.40  1.03  1.29  5.80   0.37\nm_Olive_altitude        260.57 12.55 34.90 10.76  4.18   0.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Temperature coefficients\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Altitude coefficients\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.35: Slope coefficients for the three models analysed are displayed.

    "text": "7.7 Cereal proportions\nPrevious calculations on the archaeobotanical dataset have been based on presence/absence values. This is due to the numerous biases in the samples that distort the distributions. However, this approach does not allow quantitative conclusions to be drawn. From a qualitative point of view, it can be informative to see which sites give different results by calculating the ratio of individual cereal taxa to the total number of cereal grains found in a given sample. In order to explore the quantitative trends, bearing in mind that these results are heavily biased by outliers and sample sizes, summary tables grouped by chronology have been prepared. Two tables in particular are presented here.\nThe first (Table 7.10) takes into account missing values, so that if a particular taxon was not found in a sample the missing value was converted to 0. The second table (Table 7.11) calculates the means only based on true presences, and missing values are ignored from the computation. In addition to these two tables, a different approach has also been presented. Raw data has been converted into relative ranks, which assigns increasing ranks to the count values (excluding zeros) on a scale of 0 to 1, thus minimizing the impact of extreme outliers and reducing the effects of large differences in values.\nTable 7.12 displays the means of the relative ranks, grouped by chronology. In all three approaches, the computations have been based only on totals of cereals attributed to a species. Although these tables allow some considerations on the proportions of cereals in the sites under investigation, it is important to remember that the results might be biased by the quality of the botanical samples.\n\n\n\n\nTable 7.10: Means of the proportions of cereals, calculated on the total of cereals.

    "text": "8.1 Data exploration\nAs mentioned above, the faunal dataset used in this study exhibits overdispersion, which is a common problem when analysing datasets of this type. The term ‘overdispersion’ refers to the presence of greater variability in the data than would be expected based on a normal curve (Figure 8.1).\nIn this section, we will present the distribution of the animals of interest to provide a visual representation of the dispersion within the dataset. By examining the distribution curves, we can better understand the variability that exists within the dataset, and use this information to develop more accurate models. In Figure 8.2, it is evident that the distribution of animal remains in the faunal dataset is not symmetrical and does not conform to a normal curve. This non-normal distribution indicates that the standard measures of central tendency, such as mean and median, may not accurately capture the overall distribution of the data. Traditional statistical measures, such as measures of central tendency and dispersion, are often used in frequentist approaches to data analysis. However, these measures may not be appropriate for analysing the complex patterns of animal farming and consumption in the faunal dataset due to the presence of overdispersion. As an alternative, Bayesian multilevel models can account for overdispersion by incorporating appropriate probability distributions, such as the betabinomial distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1: Probability density curves of three simulated normal distributions, representing underdispersed (sd = 0.5), normal (sd = 1), and overdispersed (sd = 2) data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.2: Distribution of animal remains in the dataset, displayed both by NISP raw value and NISP proportions."

    "text": "8.2 Chronology\n\n8.2.1 Trends by century\nThe proposed model uses a betabinomial distribution to model overdispersion in the data and estimates the precision (or shape) parameter \\(\\phi\\) in the Beta distribution. The \\(A\\) on the left side of the formula is the outcome variable, which represents the animal NISP count for each observed sample \\(i\\). The model is intercept-only, meaning that there are no further predictors included in the model. The average probability of success \\(\\bar{p}_{i}\\) is modelled through a logit link function, and is assumed to equal the intercept \\(\\alpha\\). The model is also indexed with \\({[Century]}\\) so that separate estimates can be obtained for each century (1st BCE to 11th CE).\n\\[\nA_{i} \\sim BetaBinomial(NISP_{i}, \\bar{p}_{i} , \\phi_{i})\n\\]\n\\[\nlogit(\\bar{p}_{i}) = \\alpha_{[Century]}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\alpha_{[Century]} \\sim Normal(0,1.5)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\phi_{[Century]} \\sim Exponential(1) + 2\n\\] The prior distributions selected for the model are weakly informative. Specifically, the prior chosen for the intercept \\(\\alpha\\) is a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.5. Given that \\(logit(\\bar{p}) = \\alpha\\) is modelled using the logit link, a mean of 0 corresponds to a probability of 0.50 on the logit scale. With a standard deviation of 1.5, the prior is flat and only slightly informative.\nAs for the shape parameter \\(\\phi\\), the prior was selected to ensure that the parameter was at least 2, which corresponds to a flat distribution. This value (2) was then added to an exponential distribution with rate 1 to produce a weakly informative prior.\nA prior predictive simulation (Figure 8.3) shows how when no information is provided to the model, counts on the extremes of the binomial histogram are more likely, while all other counts have similar probabilities. Bimodal priors are common practice with Beta distributions as they are non-informative enough. However, updating a bimodal prior even with one observation rapidly changes the posterior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) The simulation shows how when no data is available values on the limits are likely. New observations however rapidly affect the posterior distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Conjugate beta distribution.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.3: Prior predictive simulation for the betabinomial distribution.\n\n\nThe model for pigs’ NISP counts shows a positive trend above the millennium average (0.36) for predicted highest density intervals (HDIs) from the 1st century BCE to the 3rd century CE. The probability intervals exhibit a steady decrease that begins in the 3rd century and continues until the 8th century, when the mean of the probability distribution coincides with the first millennium average. Despite positive trends reported in the 8th and 9th centuries, interpretation of these values requires caution since the credible intervals are wider due to fewer observed samples dated to these centuries. The HDIs mean for the 10th and 11th centuries is again around the millennium average, indicating a decrease in the probability of pig occurrence.\nCattle, on the other hand, exhibit different trends, with a HDI interval in the 1st century BCE above the millennium average (0.20), although with a large credible interval, and a negative trend from the 1st to the 3rd century CE. HDIs are again increasingly positive between the 4th and 7th centuries, but decrease in the 8th century. As for pigs, HDIs means are close to the millennium average in the 10th and 11th centuries.\nThe modelled probability of occurrence of sheep/goats reveals a negative trend (below the average of 0.28) from the 1st to the 3rd century CE. The probability of occurrence then increases around the 4th/5th centuries up to the 6th/7th centuries, with HDIs stable around the mean from the 8th to the 11th century. The edible wild animals that were included in the analysis are Sus scrofa ferus (boar), Cervus elaphus (red deer), Dama dama (fallow deer), Capreolus capreolus (roe deer), Lepus sp. (hare), Glis glis (dormouse), and unspecified birds. The domestic fowl species that were analysed are Gallus g. (chicken) and Anser A. (goose). The predicted probabilities for edible wild animals and domestic poultry show relatively stable trends throughout the period analysed, with HDI means consistently below 0.10. Domestic fowl HDIs remain below the millennium mean of 0.06 from the 1st century BCE to the 2nd century CE, and then increase steadily from the 3rd century to remain around the mean until the 7th century. From the 7th to the 11th century, the HDIs remain positive, but with a much larger credible interval. Similarly, wild animals’ HDIs are positive in the 1st century BCE and remain stable around the millennium average (0.05) until the 6th century CE, after which they also show a slight increase until the 11th century.\nIn addition to plotting the probabilities of occurrence extracted by the posterior distributions, the distributions of the precision parameter \\(\\phi\\) are plotted for samples in each century. Each line is plotted with two probability intervals 0.65 (shorter thicker line) and 0.99 (longer thinner line). The probability density functions are also added to the top of the bar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.2 Trends by phase\nThe relationship between animal NISP counts and chronological phases is similar to the previous one, but with a different indexing variable for the intercept. Instead of being indexed by century, the intercept \\(\\alpha\\) is now indexed by phase (\\({[ChrID]}\\)). While a phase can span several centuries, this modification allows the model to estimate separate intercepts for each phase, providing more specific insight into potential differences in the outcome variable and the average probability of animals occurrences over time. The rest of the model structure and distributional assumptions remain the same as the previous model, which uses a betabinomial distribution to model overdispersion in the data and an intercept-only structure.\n\\[\nA_{i} \\sim BetaBinomial(NISP_{i}, \\bar{p}_{i} , \\phi_{i})\n\\]\n\\[\nlogit(\\bar{p}_{i}) = \\alpha_{[ChrID]}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\alpha_{[ChrID]} \\sim Normal(0,1.5)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\phi_{[ChrID]} \\sim Exponential(1)+2\n\\]\nAs anticipated, the phase-level trends exhibit posterior distributions similar to the more detailed century-level results. However, the phase-level model offers an advantage - the credible intervals are considerably narrower than those of the previous model. Since each phase spans several centuries, except for the medieval phase that only includes the 11th century, there are more data points available to provide more reliable probabilities.\nPigs’ NISP are at their highest point during the Roman phase, whereas they decrease in the late Roman and early medieval phase, only to be slightly below the millennium average (of 0.37) in the 11th century. The predicted millennium average is comparable to the previous century-level model (0.36), with a small difference which can be due to the grouping of the observations. The diachronical means for the other animals are also very comparable to the other with a maximum difference of ±1 for each animal.\nCattle’s NISP probabilities of occurrence increase throughout the millennium, although in the 11th century (marked as ‘Ma’ on the plot) the 99% credible interval is larger, spanning from 0.15 to 0.26. Conversely, the century-level model for this period indicated a small increase towards the millennium average.\nAs for the century-level model, the sheep/goats are the second most represented animal in the millennium. Their probability of occurrence shows HDIs just below the millennium mean (of 0.27) in the Roman and late Roman age, and positive HDIs values for the early medieval and medieval phase, a situation not so different than the century-level model. The phase-level trends for domestic fowl and wild animals show perhaps clearer trends than the century-level models. The HDI for domestic fowl, which is below the millennium mean of 0.05 in the Roman age, slightly increases in the later phases, with a peak in the 11th century. This peak is however less reliable than other phases, as the credible interval range is much larger. Wild animals posterior probabilities on the other hand are stable around the mean (0.04) with a small increase in probability during the early medieval and medieval phases. In addition to improved credible intervals as opposed to the century-level model, the probability intervals for the \\(\\phi\\) shape parameter are also more reliable, as the PDFs are more narrow and most of the values are around the mean. Unfortunately, a smaller amount of samples for the 11th century produced more dispersed curves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.2.1 Community plot\nAfter estimating the intercepts for each animal separately, they were compiled together to get a cohesive view of the probability of occurrence of the four animals. This approach is not ideal, but it can still be informative with regards to the patterns of animal exploitation in the archaeological record. The joint community plot allows to visually compare the probability of occurrence of each animal species over time and identify trends in their occurrence. For instance, the plot below shows how the predicted probability values for the four main domesticates—pigs, cattle and sheep/goats vary across the four phases. Pigs have higher probabilities during the Roman phase, while already in the late Roman period they get closer to other domesticates. It is in this period that the inter-sample variability of \\(\\phi\\) seem to decrease, although the values are not very high. The precision \\(\\phi\\) is instead very variable for edible wild animals and domestic fowl, as it can be expected given that it is much rarer to find these animals in a sample for various reasons already discussed in the methods. The high variability in the precision of the medieval (11th century) intercept and \\(\\phi\\) estimates can be explained by the lower number of samples.\nOverall, the most noticeable trends in the plot are the increased number of cattle in the early medieval period and the decreased number of pigs from the late Roman phase. Modelling each animal species separately does not fully capture the complex interactions that exist among them, and future work should explore more advanced modelling approaches that account for the co-occurrence of multiple animal species in the same assemblages.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.4: MCMC estimates for the predicted probability of occurrence of faunal remains in four chronological phases.

    "text": "8.3 Context type\nChronological models offer a broad overview of the trends in animal husbandry and consumption, both domestic and wild. It is essential, however, to consider the contextualization of animal remains since different site types can impact the NISP of a specific animal. Therefore, a detailed analysis of the specific site must be undertaken before any conclusions regarding the abundance of an animal can be reached. When applying the same method as in Chapter 7, we see how direct stratification by site type is not possible because of a backdoor path between Chronology and Site_Type that cannot be ignored. Ignoring chronological differences would imply expecting a rural villa site to have comparable production and consumption patterns in the Roman and late Roman (or even later) periods. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of how the environment in which animal remains were discovered influences the result variable, NISP, we present the directed acyclic graph (DAG) created for the botanical models. The DAG indicates that we must block by Chronology and stratify the dataset by Site_Type. To accomplish this, we introduce an interaction index (\\({[TCid]}\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.5: This is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that represents the relationship between Chronology, Site_Type, and NISP in the study. Chronology is shown as a collider variable, and its influence on NISP is mediated through Site_Type. To block the backdoor path between Chronology and NISP, the dataset is stratified by Chronology.\n\n\n\n\nThe approach for the proposed model for estimating the posterior likelihood of animal occurrence in various chronological phases and context types is very similar to the models discussed earlier. The only modification is the interaction index.

However, this study reveals divergent patterns in the presence of pigs depending on the site type and function. We will first discuss categories with narrower credible intervals before moving on to those with smaller sample sizes and wider credible intervals.\nUrban sites are the most common category, where the probability of finding pig remains follows patterns similar to the chronological trends presented earlier. During the Roman phase, the probability of finding pig remains in urban contexts is very high compared to other animals or categories, with a mean probability of almost 0.5. The consumption of pork in cities appears to have decreased during the late Roman and early medieval phase, with similar credible intervals, only to increase again in the 11th century. Although the precision (\\(\\phi\\)) in urban contexts is slightly below the across-contexts mean of 5, the curves are not too dispersed, at least in the Roman and late Roman periods, and we can be confident in these results. On the other hand, the 95% HDIs for pigs in rural contexts are lower than those in urban contexts during the Roman and late Roman periods. In the early medieval phase, the mean probabilities are comparable to urban contexts, with both categories having a mean of around 0.31, which then increases to 0.37 in the 11th century (0.39 in urban contexts). In general, while the decline in pig presence appears to be significant in urban areas, rural contexts exhibit only a slight increase.\nRural villas have been analysed separately from other rural sites due to their potential implications for the production and consumption of meat, given their status as elite sites. Although the sample size is not large enough to provide highly confident posterior predictions, the results suggest that pork was likely an important component of the diet in these sites, with a mean of approximately 0.4 in the Roman period and an increase in the late Roman phase. However, the early medieval phase is characterized by greater uncertainty, as the sample size is reduced and rural estates often changed function or were abandoned. The credible interval for this period ranges from 0.25 to 0.62. The suggested increase in pigs NISP in the late Roman period will be discussed further later (Chapter 9), as the historical debate might provide helpful hypotheses. It is worth noting that there is no sample from the 11th century for rural villas, which is why that line is not included in the graph.\nFortified sites were also large consumers of pork, with the probabilities of occurrence sticking around the mean value and a minor increase in the early medieval-medieval periods. However, there are no significant changes in trends to observe. The probabilities of occurrence in the late Roman phase are not so trustworthy as the credible interval is large. It is worth noting that there is no Roman posterior prediction on the graph because there were not fortified Roman sites in the sample except for one, the castrum of Ostia (MacKinnon, 2014), which has not been included in the observed data for this model as it was one single sample. The castrum had a 71.9% NISP proportion of pigs, out of a sample of 121 total NISP. The religious category has fewer observations than the site types presented before, and the credible intervals are wider. The Roman and late Roman religious sites mostly include temples such as the temples C and D of Grumentum, the Demetra temple in Macchia delle Valli, the Mithraeum of Crypta Balbi, and more. In the medieval phases, religious sites are mostly monasteries including the well-studied ones of Monte Gelato, Farfa, San Salvo, S. Giulia of Brescia, and San Vincenzo al Volturno. The range of credible intervals can span probabilities of 0.40, so we must be cautious in our considerations. If we look at the mean of the HDIs, a precise pattern does not emerge. However, in every chronology, the probability of occurrence of pig’s NISP is over the across-contexts average of 0.41.\nThe credible intervals for necropolis sites are too large - spanning almost the entire probability range - to trace any clear patterns. With only nine samples from seven sites, including the Roman and late Roman necropoleis of Cantone, Otranto, San Cassiano (Riva del Garda), Trieste (loc. Crosada), Poggio Gramignano, San Lorenzo di Sebato, and the early medieval necropolis of Baggiovara, the sample size is small. As a result, it is best to draw only qualitative conclusions in the later discussion.\nFinally, the last category includes only one well-known site, the Flavium amphitheater in Rome, which provided 29 zooarchaeological samples. The 95% HDIs for this site show very high probabilities, with mean values of 0.65 for the Roman and late Roman periods and 0.49 for the early medieval period. However, the credible interval is quite wide for the early medieval phase, making it less certain. This type of site was not grouped with the other urban observations as it was too unique and might have biased the results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPigs are recognised as indicators of the urban environment, as they are reared primarily for meat production. This dataset contains numerous samples from Rome and Ostia, the neighbouring port city. It is possible to model the “metropolitan” influence that these cities may have on the probability of finding pig remains in urban areas. By doing so, we can calculate the differences in probabilities between Rome and other urban sites to gain insight into their different probabilities. The results show that pigs were more prevalent in Rome than in other Italian urban centres, although they follow the same chronological decreasing trend as other cities.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.6: Estimated probabilities of occurrence of pig remains in urban sites and Rome/Ostia in four chronological phases.\n\n\n\n\nThe number of samples from early medieval and medieval (11th century) Rome is relatively small compared to other urban centers. Additionally, considering the historical context, the metropolitan effect of Rome is likely diminished during this time period. Therefore, the differences in probabilities were specifically computed for the Roman and late Roman phases, focusing on these particular periods rather than encompassing the broader historical range. In the Roman phase, there is a bigger difference between Rome/Ostia and other Italian cities (with a mean probability of 0.20). Later, this difference decreases to a mean of 0.15.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.7: Calculation of Rome/Ostia’s influence on other urban sites during the Roman and late Roman periods. This was achieved by subtracting the pigs estimates for urban urban sites from those of Rome/Ostia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.3.2 Cattle\nThe probabilities of occurrence of cattle remains in different context types have thinner credible intervals compared to pig remains credible intervals. In urban sites, no significant changing pattern can be observed, as the means of the 95% HDIs mostly lay on the mean probability of 0.20 across contexts, with the exception of the Roman period where it was below mean. Medieval urban sites exhibit increased variability, possibly due to higher uncertainty associated with less data. The mean precision (\\(\\bar{\\phi}\\) = 7 ca.) in medieval urban sites is the highest of any category.\nRural contexts show more variability in probability trends and are more in line with the results of the chronological models. The credible intervals are slightly wider than urban contexts, but can still be interpreted and discussed later. In the Roman age, the probability of cattle occurrence is highest in rural sites, increasing after the 2nd century and slightly decreasing in the medieval phases. Rural villas show stronger trends than rural sites, but with even more uncertainty. If in rural sites probabilities of occurrence of cattle NISP remains increases in the late Roman period, in villas there is an opposite trend with cattle probabilities going below the mean. As previously mentioned, data on early medieval rural villas are scarcer due to the changing functions of these sites and their lower continuity. Only six sites provided nine samples in this period: Ficarolo (loc. Gaiba-Chiunsano), Monte Torto di Osimo, Santa Marta, Villa Magna, S. Giovanni di Ruoti, and Faragola. Consequently, the resulting analysis for this category has higher uncertainty and wider credible intervals. However, the probabilities suggest a small increase again in this phase. The posterior precision parameter (\\(\\bar{\\phi}\\)) in this phase is the lowest, indicating both less data available and contradictory information in the data, contributing to the uncertainty.\nFortified sites, while exhibiting more uncertainty during the late Roman period, do not show significant changes in cattle NISP occurrences. The mean values of the 95% HDIs remain consistently above the overall mean of 0.20 in all chronologies, but only show a slight increase to around 0.25 in the medieval period, with a higher precision.\nThe trends in religious sites show similarities to those in villas, with mean probabilities dipping below the across-contexts average in the late Roman period and a steady increase in the early medieval and medieval phases. In necropoleis, the probabilities of cattle NISP are below the mean in the Roman-late Roman periods. However, in the early medieval phase, due to limited data availability (only one sample from the necropolis of Baggiovara, where cattle NISP is 74/316), the uncertainty is high, and the credible interval is too wide to draw any meaningful conclusions. This extended credible interval is due to the flat prior, indicating that the model is too uncertain to provide reliable probabilities.\nThe final category consists of only one site, the Flavium amphitheater. The probability of occurrence of cattle NISP remains in this category is relatively low and does not follow the same patterns as urban sites. There is a small decrease in the late Roman period and a potentially uncertain increase in the early medieval phase. However, the 50% HDI probabilities are consistently below the across-contexts mean.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.8: Estimated probabilities of occurrence of cattle remains in different context types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.9: Precision in the context-type beta-binomial models for cattle remains.\n\n\n\n\nIf pigs can act as a marker of urbanization, it is also important to investigate whether the consumption patterns of other animals in Rome differ from those in other urban centers. Additionally, while pigs were primarily raised for meat consumption, cattle had further purposes (e.g. agricultural purposes, leather production, etc.). To overcome this issue, it would be ideal to control for factors such as age and wear, even though this is outside the boundaries of this research and biometric data is not stored in the database. It is essential to keep this context in mind when interpreting the graphs and drawing conclusions.\nIn contrast to pigs, the analysis reveals notable distinctions in cattle consumption trends between Rome and other urban sites across different chronological phases. One notable observation is that cattle appears to be more commonly consumed in other urban cities compared to Rome. Additionally, while cattle consumption decreases in Rome during the late Roman period, it concurrently increases in other cities. It is worth noting that the credible intervals in Rome are relatively high, limiting further comparisons in other periods. However, there seems to be a positive trend again in the early medieval phase. The graph depicting the differences illustrates a narrower gap between Rome/Ostia and other cities during the Roman period, whereas the disparity becomes more pronounced in the late Roman phase.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.10: Estimated probabilities of occurrence of cattle remains in urban sites and Rome/Ostia in four chronological phases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.11: Calculation of Rome/Ostia’s influence on other urban sites during the Roman and late Roman periods. This was achieved by subtracting the cattle estimates for urban urban sites from those of Rome/Ostia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.3.3 Sheep/Goats\nAmong the contexts analysed, the probability of finding sheep/goats remains is the second highest with a mean of 0.29, following pig remains. In Roman and late Roman urban sites sheep/goats probabilities are below the mean, although there is a positive trend until the early Middle Ages. The medieval phases (6th to 11th century) show mean probabilities of 0.31. Rural sites exhibit a decreasing trend, with the 0.50 HDIs always above mean. However, even with this decreasing trend, the probabilities in rural sites are still higher than those in urban sites. In the Roman period, the sheep/goats probability of occurrence is particularly high (0.35) in rural sites and decreases in the following phases, until the 11th century, when there is a strong increase in sheep/goats probabilities (associated with more uncertainty and variability).\nRural villas show a decreasing trend in the probabilities of sheep/goats remains: the 50% HDI probabilities in rural villas remain lower than the average, with a slight decrease in the late Roman phase and a strong increase in the early medieval period, when uncertainty is also high. Although the number of samples is not as high as other categories, the mean precision (\\(\\bar{\\phi}\\) = 8.5 ca.) is high in the late Roman phase, indicating consistency in the assemblages.\nIn fortified sites, there is a decreasing trend in sheep/goats probability, starting from a high point of 0.37 in the late Roman phase and reaching below the average of all contexts in the 11th century. As for the case of most categories (except urban sites), there is a decreasing trend in sheep/goats probability until the 11th century in religious sites. However, for this category the credible intervals are quite wide, and the precision is always below average, making it challenging to draw reliable conclusions. In the case of necropoleis, the credible intervals are too large to provide any meaningful insight.\nFinally, in the Flavium amphitheater samples the 50% HDIs probabilities are below average, decreasing in the late Roman period and increasing (with extreme uncertainty) above average in the early medieval phase.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.12: Estimated probabilities of occurrence of caprine remains in different context types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.13: Precision in the context-type beta-binomial models for caprine remains.\n\n\n\n\nFor sheep and goats, similar differences were calculated between Rome/Ostia and other urban sites. The overall chronological trends in urban sites show no significant variation, while Rome and Ostia show an increasing trend, albeit with a larger credible interval after the Roman period. Again, the differences in the probabilities of finding sheep/goat remains in Rome/Ostia versus other urban sites are negative, suggesting that these animals were consumed more in other cities than in the capital. During the late Roman period, however, the mean probability approaches zero.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.14: Estimated probabilities of occurrence of caprine remains in urban sites and Rome/Ostia in four chronological phases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.15: Calculation of Rome/Ostia’s influence on other urban sites during the Roman and late Roman periods. This was achieved by subtracting the caprine estimates for urban urban sites from those of Rome/Ostia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.3.4 Edible W. Animals\nThe trends in edible wild animals are similar between urban and rural sites, with mean probabilities below the average of 0.07 during the Roman and late Roman periods. The means for urban sites are around 0.03, while those for rural sites are approximately 0.05. In the early medieval period, both urban and rural sites show a small increase, with probabilities of 0.05 and 0.06, respectively. In the medieval period, the 50% HDIs are above the mean for both urban and rural sites, reaching a peak of 0.11 in rural areas. However, caution is required for the 11th century, as the credible interval is larger and the mean precision (\\(\\bar{\\phi}\\)) is low, indicating increased variability.\nWhile the credible intervals are wider, rural villas consistently have means above the average and higher than other site types. In the Roman period, the mean probability is 0.11, which decreases to 0.09 in the late Roman phase and 0.05 in the early Middle Ages.\nSimilarly, fortified sites display 50% HDIs above the across-context mean, with a small decrease in the early medieval phase and an increase in the 11th century. Both sites show a positive correlation between game consumption and elite lifeways. Religious sites show probabilities above the mean in the Roman and late Roman periods, when these sites mostly include temples or ritual contexts. However, in the medieval phases, the probabilities decrease below the mean instead. The credible intervals for the necropoleis are too wide to draw any reliable conclusion, but it is noteworthy that there is evidence of wild game consumption in these contexts.\nThe Flavium amphitheater also exhibits probabilities below the mean, although the full credible interval extends above the mean as well. In the early medieval phase, the mean probability rises above 0.10, but the credible interval remains too wide for confident interpretation.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.16: Estimated probabilities of occurrence of edible wild animals remains in different context types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.17: Precision in the context-type beta-binomial models for edible wild animals remains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.3.5 Community plot\nTo examine the overall trends across all context types and chronologies, the probabilities of occurrence for the four animals were compiled and plotted against the precision. The resulting plot shows different context types and chronologies for each animal. Since these are separate models, multinomial regressions would be informative in this sense. These models could be explored further in future research.\nIn the Roman period, the probabilities for pigs and wild animals show clear separation among urban, rural, and villa sites. Pigs are mostly predicted in urban sites, followed by villas and rural sites. Conversely, wild animals have higher probabilities in villas, then rural and urban sites. For pigs, most of the \\(\\phi\\) values range between 3 and 8 across all contexts, while the wild animals model shows low precision values for villas and greater variability in urban and rural sites. Additionally, wild mammal probabilities in villa sites vary widely, ranging from 0.05 to as high as 0.20. In contrast, the probabilities of wild mammal occurrence in urban and rural sites are more consistent. The probabilities of cattle and sheep/goats in different contexts are less clear. Rural sites have higher probabilities for both animals than urban sites, and the probabilities for villas have wider ranges.\nHowever, adding a fourth site type in the late Roman period complicates the reading. As for the Roman period, pigs and wild animals show a separation, with pigs being more likely in urban sites and wild animals in villas, but there is a shift in probabilities in the late Roman period. Pigs are now more likely in villas, whereas wild animals remain similarly distributed. Fortified sites have variable probabilities for all animals. Cattle is more present in rural sites, followed by urban and villa sites, while sheep/goats is most likely to occur in fortified sites (with high variability), followed by rural, urban, and villa sites. The latter show a higher degree of precision.\nIn the early medieval period, there is less distinction between the different context types for all animals, except for cattle, which is more likely to occur in rural sites, followed by urban and villa sites. There are no clear trends for the other animals. In the 11th century, there is a lot of variability for all animals, possibly due to the smaller sample size. Pigs appear to be more common on urban and fortified sites, while cattle and sheep/goats are more likely to occur on rural sites. The patterns of probabilities for wild animals are highly inconsistent."

However, some observations can still be made. Firstly, it is noticeable that southern and central Italy share similar trends, albeit with different estimated probabilities. In the Roman period, central Italy has the highest 95% HDI for pigs, with a mean probability of 0.51, well above the across-regions mean of 0.36. Although 50 out of 99 samples from this period are from urban contexts, the 30 samples from rural contexts are sufficient to avoid suspicions of biases. Similarly, the credible interval is wider in southern Italy, with a mean probability of around 0.43. For both regions, the trend shows a decreasing probability of pig occurrence in the late Roman and early medieval periods. In central Italy, the 95% HDI mean values reach the across-regions mean in the early Middle Ages, while in southern Italy, most probabilities are already below the mean in the late Roman period. The analysis reveals a different pattern for northern Italy compared to southern and central Italy. The probability of pigs in northern Italy shows only a slight decrease in the late Roman period, from 0.27 to 0.26. However, there is an apparent increase in the probability of pigs during the medieval phases, although the 11th century remains uncertain due to limited observations. Conversely, in southern and central Italy, the trend is decreasing in the late Roman and early medieval periods. While the 11th century shows a slight increase in both regions, the credible interval for southern Italy is too wide for meaningful conclusions.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.19: Estimated probabilities of occurrence of pig animals remains in different macroregions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.20: Precision in the context-type beta-binomial models for pig remains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.4.2 Cattle\nSimilar patterns are observed for the occurrence probabilities of cattle in southern and central Italy. In the Roman and late Roman periods, the 50% HDIs for southern and central Italy are lower than the across-regions mean of 0.23. However, in the early Middle Ages, the probabilities increase in both regions and go above the mean. In contrast, northern Italy shows much higher mean probabilities in the Roman (0.27) and late Roman (0.32) periods compared to the other regions, but the mean decreases to 0.24 in the early Middle Ages. Due to wide credible intervals, it is difficult to provide accurate estimates for the 11th century.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.21: Estimated probabilities of occurrence of cattle remains in different macroregions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.22: Precision in the context-type beta-binomial models for cattle remains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.4.3 Sheep/Goats\nThere are distinct patterns in sheep/goats occurrence probability across the three regions examined. In central Italy, the probability of sheep/goats is consistently lower than the across-regions mean of 0.31, ranging from 0.24 to 0.26 in the Roman age to the early Middle Ages. While the 11th century credible interval is wide, most probabilities are above the mean. The model precision is particularly good in Roman and late Roman central Italy, with a peak of around 8. Roman northern Italy has the highest probability of sheep/goats occurrence in the Roman age, with a mean value of 0.36.\nHowever, after this period, the mean probabilities decrease below the mean, only to increase again in the 11th century. Nevertheless, the probability distribution for this period is not reliable. Southern Italy, on the other hand, shows a steady increase in probability from the Roman age, with the 50% HDI around the mean, to a peak of 0.41 in the early Middle Ages. However, the wide credible interval and low model precision in the 11th century prevent definitive conclusions.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.23: Estimated probabilities of occurrence of caprine remains in different macroregions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.24: Precision in the context-type beta-binomial models for caprine remains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.4.4 Edible W. Animals\nThe distribution of edible wild animals in the Roman and late Roman periods is below the across-regions mean of 0.05. In central Italy, there is an increase in the probability of game consumption from the Roman to the medieval age, with an uncertain trend in the 11th century. The precision parameter \\(\\bar{\\phi}\\) is also high in the medieval phase. Similarly, northern Italy shows an increase in the probability of game consumption in the medieval phases, while the mean probabilities decrease after the Roman age. Southern Italy, on the other hand, has a stable trend from the Roman to the early medieval period, with an uncertain increase in the 11th century. The credible interval is wide, and the model might have produced estimates in agreement with the other regions. However, there is evidence of an increase in game consumption in the 11th century in every macroregion.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.25: Estimated probabilities of occurrence of wild mammal remains in different macroregions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.26: Precision in the context-type beta-binomial models for wild mammal remains."

    "text": "8.5 Geography\nAnimals distributions can vary across different geographical features. This research has considered plains, coasts, hills and mountains as the most common geographical features in the Italian peninsula. The majority of excavations that returned faunal samples are located at low altitudes. Although - as can be expected - northern Italy provided more samples from mountain sites when compared to the other parts of mainland Italy, the other samples seem to be evenly located on on plains, coastlands and hills.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.27: Distribution of sites on different geographical features.\n\n\n\n\nThe proposed model includes two categorical predictors—Chronology and Geography. As for the previous cases, the interaction between the two variables is obtained through a dummy index (\\({[GEOid]}\\)) that is used to estimate intercepts for each period and geography. The remaining parts of the model are the same as before. Geographical features can influence the differential distribution of animals: one for instance can expect more sheep/goats NISP remains in mountain sites, but it is also important to stratify by Chronology as certain political event can change the settlement patterns and economic strategies.\nThe proposed model includes two categorical predictors: Chronology and Geography. The interaction between these two variables is obtained through a dummy index (\\({[GEOid]}\\)) that is used to estimate intercepts for each period and geography. Geographical features can influence the differential distribution of animal remains. For instance, we might expect to find more sheep/goats NISP remains in mountain sites. It is however also important to consider the time factor, as changes in settlement patterns and economic strategies over time may have been driven by political events. We do this by stratifying again by chronology in addition to geographical features. The priors used for this model are the same as in the previous models.\n\\[\nA_{i} \\sim BetaBinomial(NISP_{i}, \\bar{p}_{i} , \\phi_{i})\n\\]\n\\[\nlogit(\\bar{p}_{i}) = \\alpha_{[GEOid]}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\alpha_{[GEOid]} \\sim Normal(0,1.5)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\phi_{[GEOid]} \\sim Exponential(1)+2\n\\]\n\n8.5.1 Pigs\nThe data suggests that the probabilities of finding pig remains are generally higher in lowland areas, including coasts, plains, and hills, with mean probability values above the overall mean of 0.35 during the Roman period. However, there appears to be a general decrease in the 95% HDIs during the late Roman period, with the decline being more pronounced in plains where the mean probability drops from 0.49 to 0.34.\nIn plains, probabilities increase above the mean only in the 11th century, whereas on coastal sites, the credible interval becomes wider in the 11th century, and the mean remains below the average. Although the association between hills and pig remains probabilities seems to be always above average, there are no major patterns of chronological change.\nIn mountains, pig remains are always below the mean, but there seems to be an increase (associated with a good amount of uncertainty, as indicated by the low precision parameter and wide credible interval) in the early medieval Age. Unfortunately, no clear indication can be given for the medieval phase on mountains, given the wide credible interval that spans the entire probability range. This is due to the limited availability of samples for this period and geographical feature: the castrum of Rocca di Asolo (pigs NISP: 220/698 and 529/1837), the Toblburg Castle (94/346) and Rocchetta Nuova of Vacchereccia (60/258).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.5.2 Cattle\nIn this model, the overall predicted probabilities of cattle are consistently lower than those of other animals, with an average of 0.25. However, mountain sites show a higher mean probability for cattle compared to other geographical features. On the coasts, there is a chronological increase in cattle probabilities, with a mean value going above the overall mean in the 11th century, albeit with higher uncertainty due to the fewer available sites. Conversely, on hills and plains, the probabilities of cattle increase only slightly.\nWhat is particularly noteworthy is the trend observed in mountain sites, despite the higher uncertainty due to the lower number of available sites. Here, there is an increase in probabilities during the late Roman period, from a mean of 0.25 to 0.35, followed by a decrease in the early medieval period, although with a wider credible interval. In the 11th century, the credible interval again spans across the entire probability range, with no clear indication of the trend. Four samples from three sites are available for this period: the castrum of Rocca di Asolo (cattle NISP: 265/698 and 395/1837), the Toblburg Castle (204/346) and Rocchetta Nuova of Vacchereccia (120/258).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.28: Estimated probabilities of occurrence of cattle remains across different geographical features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.29: Precision in the beta-binomial models for cattle remains across different geographical features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.5.3 Sheep/Goats\nThe average probability for the occurrence of sheep/goats remains is 0.34 across all geographical features. On coastal sites, the mean probabilities are below average in the Roman-late Roman periods, but increase slightly in the early medieval phase and go above mean in the 11th century, although the credible interval is high and the \\(\\bar\\phi\\) is below mean. This increase is also seen on hills, where mean probabilities are below mean until the early medieval phase and decrease slightly below mean again in the 11th century.\nOn plains, the mean probabilities are always below mean - as can be expected - but generally increase. Credible intervals for mountain sites are very wide, and thus require caution in interpretation. The general trend seems to be in decline from the Roman to the early medieval phase from a mean of 0.55 to 0.45. Again, it is impossible to draw conclusions for the 11th century phase on mountains as only four samples from three sites are available: the castrum of Rocca di Asolo (sheep/goats NISP: 164/698 and 523/1837), the Toblburg Castle (48/346) and Rocchetta Nuova of Vacchereccia (68/258).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.30: Estimated probabilities of occurrence of caprine remains across different geographical features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.31: Precision in the beta-binomial models for caprine remains across different geographical features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.5.4 Edible W. Animals\nNISP from edible wild animals is always low, and the probabilities of occurrence show little variation, as most mean probability values lay around the mean of 0.09. Overall, there is a positive association between 11th century sites and game consumption in all geographical features. On plains, mean probabilities are above mean already in the early medieval period. Again, it is hard to draw conclusions for medieval mountain sites as there are only four samples available: the castrum of Rocca di Asolo (NISP: 12/698 and 39/1837), the Toblburg Castle (0/346) and Rocchetta Nuova of Vacchereccia (0/258).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.32: Estimated probabilities of occurrence of wild mammal remains across different geographical features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.33: Precision in the beta-binomial models for wild mammal remains across different geographical features."

    "text": "8.6 Altitude\nThe probability of occurrence of the most common faunal remains can be modelled using the altitude of the sites in the four periods considered. It should be noted that the sites where the zooarchaeological remains were found are not evenly distributed. In the Roman period, most of the sites investigated are located between 0 and 100 MSL, whereas afterwards there is an increasing number of remains from sites between 100 and 400 MSL. Whether this reflects a real shift in settlement patterns is beyond the aims of this study, but it may still be informative to visualise the different distribution of sites at different altitudes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proposed model for estimating the probability of occurrence as a function of altitude (the slope \\(\\beta\\)) and chronology (\\({[ChrID]}\\)) uses a betabinomial distribution to model overdispersion in the data. The \\(A\\) on the left side of the formula is the outcome variable—the animal NISP counts for each observation \\(i\\). This is a simple intercept with slope model, where the intercept \\(\\alpha\\) carries an index \\({[ChrID]}\\) as the model provides estimates for each chronology under examination. A single parameter \\(\\phi\\) indicates the precision in the Beta distribution. The DAG for this model has not been repeated as it is identical to that in Figure 7.26.\n\\[\nA_{i} \\sim BetaBinomial(NISP_{i}, \\bar{p}_{i} , \\phi_{i})\n\\]\n\\[\nlogit(\\bar{p}_{i}) = \\alpha_{[ChrID]} + \\beta_{[ChrID]}\\cdot Alt_{i}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\alpha_{ChrID} \\sim Normal(0,1.5)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\beta_{ChrID} \\sim Normal(0,1.5)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\phi \\sim Exponential(1)+2\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.34: Prior predictive simulation for the altitude beta-binomial models used in this section.\n\n\n\n\n\n8.6.1 Pigs\nThe model shows a negative correlation between an increase in altitude and the probability of finding pig remains. This result was already suggested in the models with geographical features as predictor. In fact, although the variability increases at higher altitudes (due to the more limited number of samples available), pig remains are more likely to be found in lowland areas in all chronologies. The average precision \\(\\bar\\phi\\) for the four chronologies is 5.41.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.35: Posterior distribution plot showing the occurrence of pig remains in relation to different altitudes, stratified by chronological phase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.6.2 Cattle\nIf pigs show a negative trend with increasing altitude, cattle show the opposite pattern. In each chronology, the probability of finding cattle is much higher at higher elevations. The early medieval and medieval phases show the strongest association between higher elevations and a greater number of cattle NISP remains. However, the medieval and Roman datasets do not include samples above 1.2 km.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.36: Posterior distribution plot showing the occurrence of cattle remains in relation to different altitudes, stratified by chronological phase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.6.3 Sheep/Goats\nThe correlation between sheep/goat NISP and altitude is perhaps most interesting when stratified by chronology. In the Roman and late Roman periods there is a positive correlation between altitude and the probability of finding sheep/goats NISP, meaning that sheep/goats are more likely to be found at higher altitudes. In the early Middle Ages, however, this trend diverges. The correlation begins to become negative, although not markedly so, suggesting that there are changing trends. This trend becomes increasingly negative in 11th century sites. The average precision \\(\\bar\\phi\\) for the four chronologies is 7.57.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.6.4 Edible W. Animals\nIn contrast, modeling the number of wild animal NISP remains against altitude was not very informative. The probability of occurrence of these species is always low, meaning that elevation does not seem to be a major factor in their distribution. The prediction line appears to indicate no correlation, although if we include the 0.99 credible interval, the correlation is potentially positive in all chronologies. The model performed very poorly on 11th century sites, because not many sites reported wild animal remains and the credible intervals are quite wide. In other chronologies, the credible intervals are not very large and the overall mean precision parameter \\(\\bar\\phi\\) is 15.65, indicating that the data were not very dispersed.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.37: Posterior distribution plot showing the occurrence of wild animals remains in relation to different altitudes, stratified by chronological phase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.6.5 Community plot\nTo examine the overall trends across all phases and different altitudes, the probabilities of occurrence for the four animals were combined and plotted against the slope coefficient (which in the models is multiplied by altitude). The resulting plot shows the probability of occurrence of each animal at different altitudes. The horizontal dashed line represents the probability of finding each animal at sea level. It should be remembered that these are separate models and further research should explore other models, such as multinomial models.\nIn the Roman period, pigs were the most likely remains to be found, with probabilities ranging from 0.40 to 0.45. Most of the probabilities are negative, indicating a negative correlation with altitude. This suggests that pigs were more likely to be reared in lower lying areas. Wild animals were also negatively correlated with altitude, but the correlation was not as strong as for pigs. Sheep/goats and cattle were the second and third most common animal remains found. Both were positively correlated with altitude. In the late Roman period, the probability of finding pig remains dropped to 0.35-0.34, while the probabilities of finding game animals, sheep/goats and cattle remained more or less the same. This suggests that pigs may have become less common during this period. In the early medieval period the probabilities of finding cattle and sheep/goat remains increased to 0.17-0.26 and 0.26-0.34 respectively, while the probability of finding wild animal remains decreased to 0.05-0.10.\nAlthough cattle and sheep/goats may have become more common during this period, the probability of occurrence of pigs did not change, as they remain the most common species found in zooarchaeological samples. Interestingly, sheep/goat probabilities are negatively correlated with site altitude during this period. This correlation becomes even more negative in the 11^th century phase. In this last phase there was an increased variability in the probabilities of finding all four animal remains. This may be the result of a smaller number of samples.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.38: MCMC estimates for slope and intercept plotted in the logit scale. Negative slopes indicate a negative relationship between the animal remains and increasing altitude. Intercepts were kept as a baseline occurrence probability of the species. Species on the left of the graph are rarer, species on the right are more common. It is important to notice that this represents the species response to elevation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMacKinnon, M., 2014.

    "title": "10  Conclusions",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This research represents the first comprehensive collection of legacy plant and animal count data dated to the 1st millennium CE from mainland Italy. While some synthetic works presented in Chapter 2 exist, they lack raw data or were not available when this study commenced. One of the main motivations for this research was the lack of existing large-scale analyses of past agricultural landscapes. Although further excavations targeting specific areas or chronologies are necessary, legacy data are an invaluable source to provide preliminary trends, which can later be updated in light of new information. The results have enabled discussion on macro-trends in the distribution of economically important species, contributing to broader historical debates within ancient agricultural economy studies. Particularly, bioarchaeological data have provided empirical support to historical hypotheses and interpretations, which often rely exclusively on documentary sources and settlement pattern studies.\nThe development of specific targeted Bayesian models has enhanced the precision of estimates in terms of the probability of occurrence of certain species or categories, stratified by selected geographical (region, elevation, etc.) or contextual (chronological phase and settlement type) factors. Where the number of observations was scarce, the credible intervals offered a degree of reliability. The issue of class imbalance (i.e. differences in the sizes of groups of observations) was in part addressed through partial pooling in multilevel modelling, and the use of the beta-binomial distribution in modelling zooarchaeological count data tackled the key issue of overdispersion. The goal here was not to eliminate uncertainty, but to quantify it, providing honest estimations for safer historical interpretations. Rather than being reduced, the variability in the dataset was preserved, as this might also carry archaeological and historical implications. For instance, increased variability in the distribution of species in the 7th-8th centuries further contributes to the interpretation of such centuries as a moment of change.\nOne of the advantages of statistical modelling is replicability, which allows for finer comparisons (between regions, chronological phases, etc.) beyond simple measures of central tendency (i.e. means, medians, etc.). Replicability also implies methodological transparency, which means that other researchers can reproduce our findings, as the code and dataset used in this study are publicly available on GitHub.\nHowever, both modelling in general and this research have certain limitations. Archaeology, like any social science, is inherently inexact (Smaldino, 2023, p. 11). Archaeological data can be used in models of social behaviours (such as what to grow and raise on a farm), but the data itself is only a proxy for the actual information we want to discuss. For example, the number of cereal caryopses that have been preserved in a waste pit rather than the amount of cereal grains that were produced in a given chronology. Models, while allowing for generalisations, often have low geographical and temporal resolution, especially for phases traditionally grounded in documentary sources, leading to a scarcity of radiocarbon dates and bioarchaeological samplings. While credible intervals and precision parameters provide a degree of reliability, the chronological uncertainty in the available assemblages remains one of the foremost issues in the dataset. Future research should explore methods to either address this issue or quantify the bias it introduces into estimations.\nThe reliance on generalised models in archaeological research, while beneficial for large-scale analysis, can potentially obscure micro-histories. The landscape of the Italian peninsula, broadly divided into coastal plains, hills, and mountainous areas across its three subregions, is also characterised by several micro-climates. These distinctions are crucial to understanding the history of the Italian landscape and its place in the wider Mediterranean context. We need to move towards quantitative studies that can adapt to different scales, capturing both the macro and micro aspects of the landscape. To work effectively at these different scales, a larger dataset is essential. The ongoing efforts of ‘global’ landscape archaeology projects across Italy are invaluable in this regard, as they contribute significantly to data collection. Areas with denser information will enable more sophisticated spatial studies, thereby improving our understanding of past cultural landscapes.\nThe dataset’s spatial biases stem from varying levels of effort in studying botanical and faunal remains. The availability of data in certain geographical areas appears to be closely tied to the dedication of particular research teams. For example, the abundant archaeobotanical data from the Po Valley can be attributed to the targeted work in that area of the palaeobotany laboratory at the University of Modena. Similarly, the University of Salento’s efforts have resulted in rich data from Puglia. The area of Rome is particularly rich in studies of faunal remains (largely due to the work of De Grossi Mazzorin), while virtually no archaeobotanical study was published with data from the capital. Although certain geographical areas may be more conducive to the preservation of organic material, the survey indicates that our attention should be directed towards specific regions. It is striking that for the first millennium there is very little (if any) evidence of environmental archaeology in Calabria, Umbria, Marche, Friuli Venezia-Giulia and Valle d’Aosta. Ideally, future excavations in Italy will also need to better integrate the professional figures of archaeobotanists and zooarchaeologists at the stage of the research design itself, to promote more efficient sampling strategies that permit a more thorough coverage of the site.\nIn addition to the temporal and spatial biases in the dataset, which necessitate more archaeological excavations to fill these gaps, future research should also place specific focus on underrepresented settlement types. While urban sites and smaller rural settlements are well represented, the number of small ‘peasant’ sites is still low. Initiatives such as the ‘Roman Peasant Project’ (Bowes, 2020) have started addressing this gap, but archaeological and behavioural studies of marginal social strata is arguably still at an early stage. Complementing data with other archaeological evidence, such as olive and wine presses, ceramics, agricultural storehouses, and biometric data (e.g. size, age, and sex information), is crucial for developing better historical models. This was not possible due to time constraints.\nFinally, a quantitative approach to model counts (which was not possible, as seen in Chapter 6, for archaeobotanical remains), particularly for archaeobotanical remains, and small-scale approaches to quantify agricultural yields (cf. Goodchild, 2013; Pinchetti, 2021; Witcher, 2016; Witcher and Goodchild, 2010), are essential for drawing more reliable and substantial conclusions about production and trade.\nThe field of environmental archaeology is growing in Italy, with interesting results that move away from interpretations based solely on historical literature. Although some limitations need to be overcome with targeted studies and excavations, the potential for reconstructing historical Italian landscapes is vast. Indeed, the increase in the number of data available and the quality of the publications can bring many advantages in terms of the type and precision of the statistical analyses at our disposal. For example, future studies will be able to model the spatial distribution of specific plant and animal species more accurately, which was not possible here due to these limitations and the research agenda of this assessment.\n\n\n\n\nBowes, K.

    "section": "9.1 Plant cultivation",
    "text": "9.1 Plant cultivation\n\n9.1.1 Cereals\nIn antiquity, the Italian diet relied heavily on cereals, which provided a significant source of immediate calories due to their high carbohydrate content (Brown, 2011; Grivetti, 2001; Purcell, 2003). As highlighted in Chapter 2, Rome was one of the largest “grain states” in history (cf. Scott, 2017). The city had a high demand for grain, which was partially met through imports from Africa and Egypt during imperial times (James, 2021, p. 21).\nThis research presents evidence for the local cultivation of several cereal species. Additionally, it offers insight into the practice of mixed farming during the Roman period. This insight serves as a starting point for gaining a better understanding of the farming practices employed in Italy during the first millennium CE. While previous research (Spurr, 1986) had already suggested that Roman agriculture was not based solely on the monoculture of naked wheats, more recent archaeobotanical evidence has confirmed this, showing that several types of cereal were grown in a variety of settings, including villas, small settlements and close to urban centres. Among these cereals, the most common in the archaeobotanical assemblages in the Roman period (ranging from the 1st century BCE to the 2nd century CE) were free-threshing wheat, barley and emmer. In addition to these species, other more rustic cereals – including two types of millet (Setaria italica and Panicum miliaceum) and einkorn wheat (Triticum monococcum) – were cultivated. In particular, proso millet (or ‘common millet’, Panicum m.) was especially prevalent in the south.\nIn Chapter 2, we discussed the widespread idea that hard wheat gradually superseded emmer (Heinrich, 2019, p. 104; 2017, p. 143; Lentjes, 2013; Moritz, 2002; Thurmond, 2006, p. 20). Emmer was a staple in archaic Rome and was used in preparing puls, a porridge-like soup (Thurmond, 2006, p. 29). It is difficult to determine precisely when emmer was replaced by naked wheats. This study shows that this variety of grain was not as widespread as free-threshing wheats, but it was not entirely abandoned either. On the contrary, emmer seems to be increasingly present in a greater number of sites during the later chronological phases. However, although the presence of emmer increases, from a quantitative perspective its abundance seems to decrease over the course of the 1st millennium CE.\nWhile some authors argue that emmer was the dominant hulled wheat variety cultivated in Roman times (Murphy, 2016, p. 67; White, 1995, p. 39), our research reveals a different perspective. In fact, barley, another husked cereal, was more widely cultivated and abundant. The Romans considered barley to be an inferior grain – a negative perception that dates back to at least the 3rd century BCE – mainly because it was less suitable for breadmaking due to its low gluten content. The gluten content is further reduced by roasting to remove the husk. For these reasons, barley was traditionally considered more suitable for making porridge (Thurmond, 2006, pp. 17–18).\nDespite this perceived inferiority of barley, our results show that barley consistently competed with free-threshing wheat in 1st millennium CE assemblages, and was even more common and abundant in early medieval and 11th-century samples.\nThe data presented here cannot provide precise information regarding agrarian production, given that botanical remains alone do not provide insight into the local or imported provenance. To improve understanding, this information should be integrated with other archaeological features such as storage facilities, wine and olive presses, and soil analysis. Nevertheless, the distribution of plant species across site types and regions serves as a useful proxy for understanding agrarian economic trends.\nDuring the Roman phase, free-threshing wheats and barley were predominant in rural sites, but less common in urban and villa sites. The reasons for this difference in the distribution of naked grains will be examined later in this chapter. On the other hand, it is interesting to note that the distribution of the so-called ‘minor’ grains is almost identical in all three site types. Geographically, free-threshing wheats and barley show similar patterns throughout Italy in the first phase of the study, with marked differences in the cultivation of other cereals. Geographical disparities do appear, but only in relation to altitude. Further observations show that northern Italy, even in Roman times, favoured, to a small extent, more rustic cereals compared to central-southern Italy, where their presence was limited. This trend is in line with later historical developments, indicating a greater reliance on free-threshing wheat and barley in the south, while northern and central Italy cultivated a more diverse range of cereals.\nThese findings are quantitatively supported by both our Bayesian models and a frequentist case study. In particular, the latter highlights that the distinction between northern and southern Italy - in terms of cereal cultivation - only became pronounced in the early medieval period, with Roman agricultural practices showing less significant regional variation. These findings do not necessarily confirm the link between Roman farming practices and the cultivation of a single crop. During the Roman phase, fewer crops were grown, resulting in the lowest plant richness score. At the same time, however, there was a good degree of diversity in the plant species present, indicating that no single crop dominated the assemblages to an extent that would indicate monoculture or the absolute consumption of a single plant.\nMoving into the early medieval period, our findings show that other important actors arose in the Italian countryside – the military elites located in fortified sites. While we know from the historical record that these actors might have played a significant role in influencing agriculture, there are few settlements of this type that have archaeobotanical data associated with them. Every fortified settlement recorded in our dataset, spanning from the late Roman to the medieval period, is located in Central and northern Italy, where the phenomenon of incastellamento first took hold. Despite the number of assemblages available, these sites have one characteristic in common, namely the necessity for large storage units for cereals and other agricultural goods. Free-threshing wheats and barley, with a variety of other cereals, legumes, grape remains, are present in these locations in large numbers, sometimes even more so than in rural sites. The geographical bias in the dataset towards the centre-north probably also conditions our interpretation, since it is in these regions that the archaeobotanical contexts are richest in plant species.\nThe botanical richness and abundance of remains in these sites can be mapped to the historical literature that discusses the ways that these sites would function in relation to their food storage. Military sites had to guarantee a food supply for their soldiers and those who were offered protection in exchange for taxes, which were often at a partial rate in these territories.\nAt the fortified settlement of Monte Barro, situated in Lombardy’s pre-Alps, a sizable 7.20 x 9.60 m room, referred to as ‘room f’, was likely utilised as a cereal storage facility during the 5th and 6th centuries (Brogiolo and Castelletti, 1991, pp. 37–9; Castelletti and Castiglioni, 1991). A substantial food processing and storage zone is visible in the 10th-11th century phase at Sant’Agata Bolognese, an early medieval fortified rural village (Bosi et al., 2014, p. 318). Finally, a similarly well-documented case is observed at Miranduolo Castle, which had silos in the same era that demonstrated excellent separation between various crops. This site also displays a degree of centralisation, with the largest pulses and cereals being stored within the manor court barns. Buonincontri et al. (2014) also investigated the dimensions of Triticum aestivum/durum at Miranduolo, indicating a rise during this stage in contrast with the preceding phase.\n\nExamples of castra dated between the 3rd and 6th centuries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeveragno, loc.

(2017)\n\n\n\nFrom these trends, it is evident that naked wheats did not completely replace husked wheats and other grains during the Roman age and beyond. There are various potential justifications for the cultivation of more rustic grains. Kron (2004, p. 128) argued that ancient farmers were likely aware of the nutritional benefits of feeding hulled grains to their livestock, if cereal straws were often used as animal feed. Columella (Rust., VI, 3, 3), for example, recommended millet (a C4 plant) as cattle feed.\nThe presence of millets in archaeobotanical samples is sometimes associated with the diet of low status individuals or with animal feed (Killgrove and Tykot, 2018), but this association is controversial (Murphy, 2016) and should be treated as such. The role of C4 plants in the northern Italian diet is documented through isotopic analyses (Cocozza et al., 2022). Additionally, Ganzarolli et al. (2018) disproved the assumption that millets were solely consumed by the lower strata of the population. They applied lipid residue analysis to cooking vessels dating from the 6th to 10th centuries, which showed that millets were present in both high-status and low-status contexts in Padua.\nMillet are often under-represented in samples due to their small grain size. Their short growing season, which lasts only three months, allows them to be planted between crop cycles, reducing the risk of famine in the event of poor harvests. Therefore, millets are often considered a marker of ley farming and crop rotation (Spurr, 1986, pp. 94–101). Indeed, Pliny the Elder (HN, XVIII, 23) reports that in the Campanian fields millet was sown in alternation with emmer (Murphy, 2016, p. 68).\nFurthermore, barley and millets can withstand drought, which would have made them especially beneficial in southern regions with little annual rainfall like Apulia and Calabria (Crespi et al., 2018). During the Roman period, proso millet was a popular cereal in southern Italy, found on 42% of the studied sites. Upon closer inspection of the sites leading this trend, it is clear that Pliny’s claim (HN, XVIII, 24) that “millet thrives in Campania” is supported by the archaeobotanical evidence. The places where millet is found in the Roman period are situated in the regions of modern-day Campania and Basilicata. These include multiple spots within Pompeii and Herculaneum, as well as in Pantanello. Millet’s suitability to grow in specific climates is debated. Philip Jones (Jones, 1966, p. 100) stated that millet can only grow in wet regions such as the Po Valley, the Alps, and some parts of Campania. However, the results of the archaeobotanical study indicate that millets are also found in different regions, and studies have indicated that they grow best in arid climates, as extended contact to water might harm the plant as well as its output (Caruso et al., 2018). To assess this, we tried using current yearly rainfall to predict results in our models, but the results were not better than using altitude. With more data on both dry and wet regions, future models may be able to use this variable more fruitfully.\nOther cereal crops, in addition to millets and barley, can withstand harsh soil and weather conditions. Some of these crops are also highly nutritious, despite their lower levels of gluten and carbohydrates (Buonincontri et al., 2017). For example, rye was more frequent in early medieval central and northern Italy, and einkorn (Triticum monococcum), which was commonly cultivated throughout the 1st millennium in central and northern Italy (often planted on hills).\nThere has been substantial scholarly discussion regarding the reasons behind the growth in rye consumption in late Roman Italy, with several explanations proposed. Some have argued that the Lombard migrations of the late 6th century introduced a preference for rye in Italy1, while others attribute the cultivation of this grain to the cooling trend of the 6th and 7th centuries. Rye is a winter crop that can resist both frost and drought (McCormick, 2013), making it a valuable resource in the difficult agricultural conditions of the time. These qualities help clarify why, during the early medieval phase, our altitude-based models indicated a higher likelihood of finding rye at high altitudes. Prior to this research, a study of archaeobotanical evidence from 3rd century BCE to 6th century CE in northern Italy also reported an increase in the frequency of Secale from the 3rd century CE (Bosi et al., 2020, p. 692). The trend is confirmed by our mean relative ranks, which increase sharply after the Roman period.\nRye was not the only type of cereal to become more common after the Roman period. Other rustic grains were more ubiquitous and abundant in both rural and urban areas, with a steep rise in the early Middle Ages. In addition to their ability to withstand adverse weather conditions, husked grains may have become popular because of their longer shelf life. The husk protects the caryopsis from pests and bacteria, increasing its durability. This would have been especially beneficial to small farmers or tenants who may not have had access to more advanced storage facilities. All these circumstances may have encouraged small farmers to sell their surplus naked wheat on the market. Cereals offered greater market security, at least locally, than other products such as olives and grapes, which faced higher external competition. Furthermore, the initial establishment of olive groves and vineyards demands significant upfront investments before yielding profitable returns (Heinrich, 2017).\nAlthough environmental, political, and economic factors, in addition to the cultural influence of new settlers, had a role in the rise of rustic cereals in central and northern Italy during the early medieval period, it is important to consider the ways in which these cereals mitigated risk for farmers. By being less labour intensive, more durable, and quick to grow, ‘minor’ grains would have been a safe investment for farmers at the time (Squatriti, 2019) - especially for feeding the household.\nThis discussion begs the general question: what factors contributed to the different agricultural strategies observed in early medieval southern Italy compared to the north? Although there are limitations to this research (which will be considered further in the conclusion), it is possible to propose some explanatory theories from the results of this study.\nFirst, the different agricultural situation in early medieval southern Italy can be thought of in terms of the strong focus that the region had on cereal agriculture, as previously noted by Masssimo Montanari (1988).\nWhile textual sources from this period scarcely mention crops with precision, the few documents dated before 1000 CE reveal the commercial and urban nature of the south, with frumentum (wheat) still being used as currency in transactions. Although ordeum (barley) is occasionally referred to, other grains are rarely mentioned in the transactions documented in the historical literature from this period (Montanari, 1988, pp. 125–130). The lower prevalence values of husked cereals in the southern regions of Italy point to a shift in farming practices that started at least in the 3rd century CE. The only grain that is consistently seen throughout all phases is emmer, which was common in Roman times and never died out.\nThese changes must be seen in a wider historical context. The annona imports from Egypt, which had previously been sent to Rome, were probably diverted to the new centre of power, Constantinople, which became the new capital of the Roman Empire in 330 CE. This left mainland Italy without a major production centre, meaning that southern landowners, especially those with massae fundorum, would have increased their production of naked wheats (Volpe, 1996). Volpe (2001) describes this as the ‘wheat march’, in which the vast Tavoliere region of northern Puglia, with its large areas of land suitable for extensive agriculture, would have been a prime location for an increase in production. The production of wheat in Apulia and Calabria later reached its peak in the mid-5th century, following the Vandal invasion of North Africa, resulting in the emergence of a “late antique agrarian system” (Volpe, 1996).\nThe effects of the reorganisation of production following the transfer of the capital to Constantinople are evident in the archaeological record. First, much of the North African grain was transported to Italy in ceramic vessels, the number of which gradually decreased before disappearing in the 7th century (Arthur, 1997; Delogu, 1993). Secondly, our results confirm the intensification of wheat production in the south, a trend that continued throughout the early medieval period (6th-10th century CE) and even beyond. In contrast, the diversity in northern Italian archaeobotanical assemblages seems more indicative of small-scale farming. In this regard, Wickham (2005) hypothesised that certain cereals, such as millet and rye, experienced an increase in popularity in central and northern Italy due to the growing decision-making autonomy of farmers. This type of agriculture is also compatible with urban gardening, as intensive production techniques were gradually introduced in more urbanised areas (Goodson, 2021, 2018). Despite these changes in the north, southern Italy remained dominated by free-threshing wheats, barley, and emmer. The almost complete disappearance of husked wheat varieties in the south and the concentration on the cultivation of naked grain can be attributed to the need to feed Rome after the disruption of the annona system. This hypothesis is also supported by the significant investments made by the Roman aristocracy in the south during this period, in particular the investment in storage structures at the villa of Faragola (Ascoli Satriano) and other buildings related to the stocking and processing of cereals (Volpe, 2023, p. 621).\nThe fragmentation of cereal production across regions was not a phenomenon unique to Italy. Jean-Pierre Devroey (2019) outlines a division between southern and northern cereal cultivation more broadly in Europe after the year 1000. In this analysis, there seems to be an “old” rotation of barley and free-threshing wheats in southern Europe, and a “newer” rotation that alternated free-threshing wheats, oats, rye, and barley. If we accept this hypothesis, this would imply that temporally, geographically, and contextually uneven cereal trends in Italy from the Roman to the early medieval period were consistent with a broader fragmentation occurring on a European scale.\n\n\n9.1.2 Legumes\nAlthough cereal and cash crops dominate the discussion of ancient agrarian economy, legumes were an important addition to the range of cultivated plants in the first millennium. Among the cultivated pulses, the species of the genus Vicia were particularly predominant. This includes V. faba minor (fava beans), V. sativa (common vetches), among others. Other common pulses in the Italian contexts include garden peas, grass peas, lentils and chickpeas.\nIn the Roman period, legumes were widely cultivated throughout Italy, with a slight predominance in the southern regions where Vicia sp. pulses were especially common. Legumes are particularly present in religious settings, likely used as ritual offerings. For instance, a 1st century BCE offering in Pompeii’s shrine at domus VI, 1, 13 included four types of legumes, and a 1st century CE layer revealed five different species (Murphy et al., 2013). Similarly, three pulse varieties were found in a 1st century BCE ritual offering in the garden of Amarantus’s domus in Pompeii (I, 9) (Robinson, 2002). Pulses were a frequent find in Roman funerary and other ritual contexts, a fact supported by our models. This is also evidenced in several cremation sites across Italy and Europe (Bouby and Marinval, 2004; Matterne and Derreumaux, 2008; Reed et al., 2019; Rottoli and Castiglioni, 2011; Vaz et al., 2021).\nBeyond these ritualistic uses, legumes were found in urban, rural, and villa sites alike. While their presence slightly decreased in urban settlements during the late Roman period, the estimated mean remained relatively stable in rural sites and villas. In fact, legumes played a significant role in agriculture due to several reasons. As highlighted in Chapter 2, legumes are fundamental to crop rotation because of their nitrogen-fixing qualities. Although the scientific understanding of this came much later, Romans recognised that legumes helped to replenish soil depleted by cereal cultivation (Flint-Hamilton, 1999, p. 373).\nLegumes were also valued as good emergency crops because of their short growing cycle, useful if autumn-sown crops failed (Erdkamp, 2019, p. 298; 2005, p. 73). In a mixed-farming setting, legumes also served as excellent animal feed, with fava beans, grass peas, and vetches being the most common feeds (Jones, 1990). Some pulses, like fava beans, had dual purposes: they were dried for human consumption, and their pods were used as animal feed (Flint-Hamilton, 1999, p. 380; Zohary et al., 2012, p. 102).\nFinally, the Romans were also likely conscious of pulses as a valuable source of protein and appreciated their nutritional properties. This awareness is evident in urban dietary patterns, where pulses were an integral component. However, the elite often associated legumes with the diets of poorer social strata, although they still consumed them as indicated by our results and documentary evidence (Brown, 2011; Corbier, 2013; Garnsey, 1992; Witcher, 2016, p. 468). The high presence of pulses in late Roman and early medieval castra, alongside cereals, further emphasises the role of pulses as a readily available and storable source of protein.\nIn both rural and urban sites, there was a notable increase in legume consumption during the early Middle Ages. While in the Roman period, pulses were sometimes added to flour to make a denser, heavier bread known as lomentum (Flint-Hamilton, 1999, p. 372), in the early medieval period, they were likely more commonly consumed in soups. Although our data cannot confirm this shift, it is supported by changes in ceramic evidence. For instance, there was a rapid increase in the number of olla types (rounded vessels) from the 5th-6th century, indicative of a transition to boiled dishes (Giovannini, 2002, p. 77; 2001, pp. 68–69). The rise in legume cultivation of this period, particularly in central Italy, persisted in the 11th century. The 11th-12th centuries marked the beginning of the agrarian revival, during which legumes were effectively integrated into the three-field system (Montanari, 2014, p. 83).\n\n\n9.1.3 Olives and grapes\nIn addition to cereal crops, this research demonstrates the economic significance of two other constituents of the Mediterranean triad, namely olives and grapes. The first evidence of consumption and production of olives and grapes in Italy dates back to the 2nd-1st millennia BCE (Buono and Vallariello, 2002; Magri et al., 2015; Mercuri et al., 2013); at the beginning of the 1st millennium CE the production of oil and wine is attested throughout the peninsula, as evidenced by archaeological sources including presses, palmenti (treading floors), and other facilities (Caracuta, 2020; Dodd et al., 2023; Dodd, 2022; Rossiter, 1981). We can thus be confident that both species were fully domesticated in our period of interest, and we can consider the botanical remains as indicative of production/consumption patterns.\nThe cultivation of vineyards and olive groves depends on certain geographic conditions, with similar requirements in terms of altitude and climate. This similarity was evident in our models, as the best conditions for both crops involve lower altitudes and milder, warmer temperatures. In particular, the distribution of olive pits seems to be especially sensitive to environmental factors. The correlation between higher elevations and a lesser presence of both crops is more pronounced during the Roman and late Roman phase, and not as apparent in later phases. This could indicate that in earlier periods mountain communities were more dependent on imports of oil and wine from more suitable production areas, while in the early medieval period production had to be reorganised to be more local. To provide additional evidence for this hypothesis, a review of how wine and oil amphoras were distributed at different elevations is necessary, even though it has not yet been explored in current archaeological literature.\nIn our database, settlements with palaeobotanical samples from high elevations and the lowest mean temperatures are prominently situated within the Alpine region. We can therefore anticipate stronger markers for olive and grape growing in southern-central regions, or the Po Valley in the north, where extensive excavation and sampling have been undertaken. On this matter, Roman and late Roman textual sources reveal high yields in the large plains of the Po region, particularly for wine; after all this area was part of the Italia Annonaria, that had to supply the capital and, importantly, the army stationed outside the peninsula (Pini, 1990, p. 337). In fact, although in the Roman period both cash crops are most prevalent in the southern regions (especially olives), they decrease during the transition to the 3rd century CE, but the presence of grapes remains stable in the north.\nThe analysis of the trends in central Italy is more difficult. As the available late Roman sites in central Italy (listed in Table 9.1) are very few and the resulting credible intervals are wide, a qualitative approach to our interpretations may be useful. Most of the archaeobotanical assemblages, dated between the 2nd and 6th centuries CE, are mostly located in the present-day region of Tuscany. Among these, the well-known case of the villa of Settefinestre, southern Tuscany (Jones, 1985). The excavation report only lists the plant species that have been found, without providing quantitative information or a clear separation of phases. In the Roman period, the villa certainly produced both oil and wine, as evidenced by the presses. The chronology of the late Roman layers is not clear, and the more precisely dated layers are earlier than the third century. On this basis, it is not possible to be more precise, but judging by the size of the villa and the artisanal and agricultural activities associated with it, it is likely that production at Settefinestre was substantial.\nTwo other sites, dated between the 2nd and 3rd centuries, are located not too far from Settefinestre. The first, Volterra, is an urban sites where archaeobotanical samples have been taken from dark earth layers, which would suggest that agricultural activities may have taken place within the city’s walls during this period. The assemblages do not record olives or grapes, although the sample size is very small (as is often the case with this type of archaeological sediment) and does not allow us to generalise (Motta, 1997). The second site, Marzuolo, is a small farmhouse. Both olive trees and vines are attested here through carpological and pollen studies. The excavators, taking into account the other archaeological finds, suggest that small-scale trade took place in Marzuolo, probably in oil and wine (Bowes, 2020).\nIn the same period, another rural site near Marzuolo, Case Nuove, reported the abandonment of a wine press. Archaeobotanical evidence from Case Nuove is only available for the 4th-5th century, which show however that grapes and olives were transported here in Late Antiquity, while pollen indicates that olives were grown about 1 km from the site (Bowes, 2020; Mercuri et al., 2020a). The small-scale production of wine is also documented from another 5th-6th century farmhouse near Volterra. This farm probably practised mixed farming, with cattle providing manure to be used for growing cereals and vines (Motta, 1997; Motta et al., 1993). Unfortunately, our database does not include any other site dating back to this period, with the exception of the so-called Schola Praeconum in Rome, where only one grape seed was found dating back to the 5th century (Whitehouse et al., 1982).\nTo our knowledge, only one late antique villa site with archaeobotanical remains has been excavated in central Italy. The site, Villamagna, is situated in the present-day region of Marche and reports large quantities of processed grape and olive remains from a room in the pars urbana during the 5th century.\nAs this information is preliminary and unpublished2, Villamagna has not been included in the database. With the exception of the small sample from the Schola Praeconum, the total absence of archaeobotanical samples from the area surrounding Rome and Latium is striking. This absence affects all the periods under consideration, and is particularly noticeable in view of the vast number of zooarchaeological samples studied in the capital. Given this critical absence, it is not possible to comment on potential productive reorganisations in this area during the late empire. The few available sites from central Italy dated between the 3rd and 6th century do seem to indicate that the types of crops cultivated does not change drastically: olives and grapes are cultivated, although at a small scale, which is in line with the size of the farmhouses from where the samples have been collected.\n\n\nTable 9.1: Late Roman sites in central Italy that provided archaeobotanical macroremains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite\nChronology\nContext\nNotes\nReference\n\n\n\n\nSettefinestre, Phase 2\n2nd-3rd century CE\nrural villa, wine pressing area\nThe report did not contain any quantitative information.

However, more observations or strong prior information are required to generate models with credible intervals that allow further discussions on these topic. At the present state, this research is not able to make robust associations between these trends and historical events, due to the qualitative nature of this discussion and the limitations in the dataset.\nTo address this issue, we could comment on previous historical work on the topic. Using settlement and ceramic data, some scholars pre-date the decline to the infamous “third-century crisis” (see Chapter 2). At this time, the number of settlements was in decline, including villas. The contraction of settlements was also accompanied by a decline in the production of Italian wine amphorae, with some workshops abandoned in the early 2nd century (Arthur, 1987). The villa-system crisis has been linked to the greater specialisation of other areas of the Empire in the production of cash crops, which were also imported to Italy (cf. Tchernia, 2016, p. 312). In this regard, Marzano (2007, p. 199) states:\n\nThe idea that imports of wine and oil from Spain and Gaul put Italian slave-labor estates in difficulties, forcing a move towards tenancy and extensive cereal agriculture goes back to Rostovtzeff.\n\nAlthough dated, Rostovtzeff’s hypothesis is not to be entirely dismissed. A recent study (Jérôme et al., 2023) conducted on 30 sites in south-western France, bordering Spain, indicates that vine cultivation was still flourishing in this region between the 3rd and 5th centuries CE. It is certainly not feasible to discuss market competition dynamics using palaeobotanical information alone, but what is interesting in Jérôme et al. (2023)‘s study is that the concentration of grape remains during this transition period is noticeably higher in rural sites rather than villas. This situation is entirely analogous to what our models’ results show for Italy.\nTherefore, whether external competition had an impact on Italian wine production in this period, its impact might have not been uniform across Italy, as we have observed earlier. Ceramic evidence also suggests that this crisis did not affect all winemakers:\n\n[…] competition from wine from Gaul would have harmed northern Campania and ruined the wine-growers in central Etruria, while sparing those in northern Etruria. Lastly, when the crisis in Italy is believed to have been at its worst, the end of the second century, there is even clearer evidence of another crisis in Gallia Narbonensis (Tchernia, 2016, p. 313).\n\nThe transformations occurring in the Italian countryside after the 3rd century had an effect not only on the prominent growers who exported wine to the provinces, but also on the smaller rural communities. Our results demonstrate that rural settlements were increasingly engaged in cultivating lucrative crops, including a rise in olive oil production, while such activity decreased significantly in the villas. However, the rural settlements’ network likely stretched fewer distances than the villa-produced wine and oil did in previous times. We also have to consider that the decrease in the number of wine and oil amphorae finds during this period is possibly due to the transport of these goods in perishable containers (Panella and Tchernia, 1994, p. 159).\nIn certain areas of the peninsula, this contraction and change in productions must have instead been a deliberate choice. (Tchernia, 2016; 2016, p. 305) reports that in the southern regions of Apulia and Calabria, for instance, olive groves were starting to disappear already in 50-30 BCE, as evidence from amphoras show. Our results, based on archaeobotanical evidence, also indicate a slow and general decrease in the south, which is not linked to any particular type of settlement. The reasons for this decrease are yet not entirely clear. Manacorda (1995, 1994) suggests that in Calabria the fall was caused by the shift of the region’s attention towards livestock breeding during Roman times. In contrast, Tchernia (2016) argues that market competition was the reason behind it. In the absence of zooarchaeological data from Calabria in this period, it is only possible to comment on other southern regions, which seem to have an agropastoral focus in the Roman phase. If this also applies to Calabria, Manacorda’s interpretation seems reasonable. Whether this was also the result of a strong foreign market competition cannot be discussed with our data, as we would require samples from earlier periods.\nThis debate also serves as a useful starting point for commenting on some of the regional trends that emerged from our study on the presence of olives. In southern Italy, our analysis confirms an overall negative trend in olive cultivation during the first millennium CE. Even during the 11th century, which is often associated with widespread agricultural revival, there does not appear to be a resurgence of olive growing. The revitalisation of olive cultivation in southern Italy must have been happened after, with a stronger establishment under Norman rule in the 12th century CE (Caracuta, 2020; Cortonesi, 2018, pp. 24–25; Martin, 1987, pp. 122–125; Pini, 1990, pp. 346–7).\n(Pini, 1990; 1990, pp. 338–9) reported the strongest decline in Italian olive farming and viticulture during the 6th and 7th centuries, implying that these crops were sustained either through wild variants or by cultivating them within the city limits, even in areas of cities that had been abandoned. As for olive farming, it is not possible here to deal with the varieties present in the botanical samples of this period at the subspecies level, but one can rightly consider this interpretation too drastic. In fact, the models and ubiquity scores never reported complete disappearance of olive pits in any of the Italian sub-regions. On the contrary, some regions specialised in olive growing. Already in the early medieval phase, sources report that the Lake Garda region in particular was well-known for its olive oil, and the establishment of olive groves was encouraged by monastic foundations like Santa Giulia di Brescia and San Colombano di Bobbio. The area around Lake Garda is particularly suitable for olive growing because the lake creates a microclimate similar to that of the southern Mediterranean, with moderate temperatures (Varanini, 2005). It is also plausible that olive cultivation was necessary for Christian liturgies, since olive oil, like wine, was used in religious ceremonies. Although our database contains archaeobotanical data from five sites in the immediate vicinity of the lake shore, none of them reported olive pits, so we cannot provide evidence for the specialisation of this region.\nIn line with the scenario suggested for olive production, the alleged late antique decrease in wine production proved less catastrophic than expected, with the exception of southern Italy where the shift towards cereal farming had already commenced in the 3rd century. In general, a contraction most likely occurred within the large-scale farming operations typically associated with these crops. The analyses in this research demonstrates that the number of vineyards declined, and those that survived had to diversify their farming strategies to cater to different markets. While we cannot comment on yields, after the 3rd century CE, the presence of grape remains consistently remained high (means above 0.40) in all regions and context type, excluding religious sites (where the model provided high density intervals that were too large to be trusted).\nRemains of olives and grapes were not exclusively present on large rural estates but were also prevalent in urban settings, as evidenced by their significant presence in various archaeological contexts indicative of consumption. For instance, the marked presence of these botanical remains is evident in urban sewers, as demonstrated in Herculaneum (Rowan, 2017), in waste pits in Cremona (Castiglioni and Rottoli, 2018), and within residential complexes in Pompeii (Domus VI, 1 – IX, 8) (Carra, 2017; Murphy, 2018). Moreover, the presence of these crops is consistently high across both large rural estates and smaller farmhouses. The attempt to apply a purely quantitative analysis to these crops, akin to the methodology used for cereals, proved problematic due to the prevalence of outliers in the data, particularly concerning grapes and olives. This constraint hindered a comprehensive evaluation of the distinct contributions made by each crop towards the overall production of a particular site, which could have been informative. Nevertheless, it is plausible to suggest that smaller farmhouses also participated in the cultivation of cash crops already before the aforementioned supposed crisis, focusing on intensive, specialised production suitable for local markets rather than extensive farming aimed at large-scale exports. In this context, the perspective of Jean-Pierre Vallat (1991, p. 14) is noteworthy; he posits that:\n\nA slave villa such as Settefinestre might concentrate on oil, wine and polyculture, while small farms might prefer specialized production of valuable oil or wine or other market crops such as poultry, fish, or fruit.\n\nSpecialisation does not necessarily lead to monoculture, as seen in the varied range of cereals and legumes present in rural areas, hinting at the implementation of ley farming practices. Typically, Roman villas display a narrower variety of cereal types compared to smaller rural sites, which embrace a broader diversity as a risk mitigation strategy.\nThe differences in farming practices are more pronounced in the later phase as far as olive growing is concerned. While the presence of olive remains is stable (if not slightly increasing) in smaller farms, it decreases in larger agricultural operations. Although most of the sites in our database are located in the north, there is no strong imbalance in the location of settlements between Roman and late Roman assemblages, which may provide grounds to think that variations in the data may reflect actual agricultural changes.\nThese variations are interesting reflecting back on what we have seen for cereal farming. In the transition to late antiquity, the number of ‘minor’ cereals increases in central-northern urban and rural sites, and then explodes in the early medieval period in both types of sites. In large private agricultural estates, on the other hand, cereal cultivation certainly also increases (at the expense of cash crops), but mainly for naked grains and barley. All other crops – at least those under examination – slowly decline in villas in the later phases, while increasing in other rural and urban sites.\nWe can notice in our models a gradual increase in grape cultivation in rural areas from the 11th century onwards. Nogara-Mulino di Sotto, a medieval village on the Tartaro River, just a few kilometres north of the Po River, shows a widespread cultivation of grapes during the 10th century. This is also indicated by the presence of grape pollen, which is typically not dispersed far from its source (Marchesini et al., 2011, p. 173). Between the 9th and 11th centuries, macroremains in Nogara were found to consist mainly of Vitis vinifera (Castiglioni, 2011). Historical records document intensified aristocratic investment in suburban rural areas of northern Italy during this time, where fields were transformed into vineyards to meet the demand of the expanding urban population. However, despite the limited number of assemblages from this period, the quantitative proportions present a different perspective, with only a handful of sites where the grape pips dominate the assemblage. It is only later that vineyards gradually replace other crops and become the dominant characteristic of rural landscapes; during the late Norman era in southern Italy and the second half of the 14th century in the Po Valley (Cortonesi, 2003, pp. 6–7). Since the dataset limits the upper boundary to the 11th century, there are no samples from this period to support this conclusion.\n\n\n9.1.4 Other fruits and nuts\nThe research aimed to contribute to the study of agricultural practices in the first millennium CE by focusing on the most economically significant plants and animals. Concentrating on species of secondary economic importance falls outside the scope of the project. Nevertheless, it is immediately evident that the diversity of species cultivated or used in this period is vast: the heatmap in Figure 7.1 shows a great diversity of fruits and nuts consumed in the first millennium. There have been several studies so far focusing on the introduction of species into the Italian peninsula, especially in the Neolithic period but also beyond.\nRecently, Bosi et al. (2023) explored the introduction of new crops in northern Italy during the first millennium CE. They note that most of the new introductions dated to this period are related to fruits. During the data collection phase, we came across many fruit types in the publications, some of which were not included in the dataset because they are rather rare and infrequent. This was also one of the main problems in modelling fruit species. The use of binomial models is not the most appropriate choice, as they would severely under-represent rarer species, which may instead be rarer for preservation reasons. Dedicated studies are therefore needed to overcome this problem with more appropriate distributions that can handle zero-inflated counts.\nDespite being outside the primary scope of this research, fruits are worth discussing as they were clearly abundant (as evidenced by the model results) in each period. In particular, in the Roman period the results showed a high diversity of fruits in urban sites, reflecting wider access to markets. This diversity decreased in the late Roman period, only to increase again in the 11th century. Conversely, rural sites increased their cultivation of different types of fruit after the end of the Roman period, indicating an increased importance of this resource in peasant diets.\nAmong the fruits consumed during this period, figs, peaches, and nuts deserve special mention. One of the emblematic fruits of the Roman period is the fig. The fig is an integral part of the Mediterranean botanical heritage (Zohary and Spiegel-Roy, 1975). Commonly cultivated alongside vines and olive trees (Zohary et al., 2012), its importance in the diet of the first millennium is illustrated by palaeobotanical evidence, particularly from the 1st century BCE to the 3rd century CE, and again from the 10th century CE onwards. Figs are frequently discovered in substantial amounts within archaeological samples and may overshadow the presence of other seeds. On occasion, they are also found alongside other small seeds such as grapes. This is commonly attributed to their typical consumption as whole fruits, leading to seed mineralisation and preservation within latrines (Bosi et al., 2011). The consumption and disposal of figs across multiple settlements are widely evidenced by numerous archaeological findings recorded in our database. The following examples represent just a small selection of the data available:\n\nDomus of Triclinium, Pompeii (Insula VI, 1, 1), which yielded a remarkable amount of 15,101 fig achenes from a toilet feature (Murphy, 2015).\nHerculaneum, with more than 1,000 fig achenes recovered from the cardo V sewer (Rowan, 2017).\nPiazza Marconi, Cremona, with 2,608 achenes recovered from a wastepit (Castiglioni and Rottoli, 2018).\nModena, Cassa di Risparmio, with 8,692 achenes recovered from a wastepit (Bosi et al., 2017).\nCascina S. Martino, Trezzo sull’Adda, with 499 achenes found in a wastepit (Castiglioni and Rottoli, 2012).\n\nAnother fruit that appeared on Roman markets and rapidly gained popularity is peach. The introduction of this fruit (Prunus persica) in Roman times has already been studied by Sadori et al. (2009), who report its introduction from the 1st century CE. We could probably anticipate this date to the 1st century BCE, given more recent excavations that report the presence of peaches in Pompeii: the so-called Soap Factory (Insula VI, 1, 14) is the only context in the dataset where the peach is present before the 1st century CE (Murphy et al., 2013; Murphy, 2015). Pliny referred to the fruit as costly (Jashemski and Meyer, 2002), and we find depictions in the frescoes of elegant villas in the Vesuvian region, as the cryptoporticus of the Domus of the Stags in Herculaneum (Insula IV, 21) (Croisille, 2015). Our results show that the ubiquity of peaches decreased from the 4th century onwards. Nevertheless, this figure increased again in the peninsula towards the end of the early Middle Ages.\nIn addition to figs and peaches, a range of fruits were present on the tables of Italy during the 1st millennium CE, including domestic and wild varieties such as plums, pears, apples, various types of berries and even exotic fruits like dates. Excluding religious and funerary sites, which typically contain fruits and pulses such as dates, grapes, olives, pomegranates, nuts, lentils, and chickpeas (Caracuta and Fiorentino, 2017; Robinson, 2002; Rottoli and Castiglioni, 2011), our models clearly indicate that the highest fruit variety in the Roman period could be found in urban sites and rural villas. It is interesting – as already noted – that these sites exhibit an immediate decline during the late Roman period, whereas there is a gradual rise up to the 11th century in rural sites.\nDespite their gradual decrease, fruits remained a crucial constituent of the early medieval city, holding a significant role in the diet. Their proportions as usually lower in publications than those of cereals, as fruits are commonly consumed in a relative short time rather than stocked, and as a consequence we rarely find large charred assemblages. In Chapter 2, we discussed the topic of urban gardens, highlighting the common practice of cultivating different plant species within city walls during the late antique and early medieval period. The findings from this study seem to corroborate this assumption, with the increasing richness in urban contexts of edible plant species. In particular, this increase seems to be more related to cereals and pulses rather than fruits, probably as a way of dealing with the uncertainty of the times and to save on taxes (Andreolli, 1990, p. 183). In the kitchen garden at Brescia (Ortaglia) from the 6th to the 7th centuries, archaeobotanical remains indicate the cultivation of at least eight varieties of cereals and four types of pulses; the remains of fruits were rare, with only one walnut, grape, and peach remain (Castiglioni and Rottoli, 2019). It is reasonable to assume that an urban kitchen garden would include fruit trees interspersed with cereal and legume crops grown in their proximity. Goodson (2021) examined textual sources to investigate this phenomenon in various Italian cities, such as Rome, Naples, Milan, Lucca, Ravenna, Bari, and others. This analysis is valuable because many of these major cities lack archaeobotanical analyses, a situation aggravated by the challenges in deposition and preservation (see Chapter 3).\nIn some cases, textual sources point to the special care of urban gardens. The ‘dark earths’, i.e. the accumulation of organic material in cities, a phenomenon typical of the early Middle Ages and particularly evident in the 5th and 6th centuries, have often been interpreted as indications of urban decline and ruralisation. Some archaeologists propose however that they may alternatively be part of a methodical and centralised system that integrated the requirement for urban waste disposal with the agricultural undertakings that occurred within multiple urban areas (Arthur, 1991; Goodson, 2021, pp. 73–4; La Rocca, 1986). In the early medieval period, cultivating the city became a necessity:\n\nGiven the absence of commercial-scale farming of fresh food, apart from grain and some olives and wine grapes, household- level cultivation was, for the period between about 500 and 1050, the principal means of acquiring fresh food for most city-dwellers (Goodson, 2021, p. 235).\n\nWe must also consider that agriculture was not the only way of acquiring food resources. At this stage it is hard to provide robust interpretations, but we believe that the increased presence of wild fruits (i.e. berries and other undomesticated fruits) in late Roman and early medieval urban botanical assemblages does not depend on sampling bias, but it is rather a sign of an increased need on the part of city dwellers to make use of all the resources at their disposal.\nIn addition to the fruits mentioned so far, another significant category of produce were nuts. The dataset reports counts of hazelnuts (Corylus avellana), walnuts (Juglans regia), and chestnuts (Castanea sativa). These nutritious and storable taxa were fairly common among classical and post-classical assemblages, and could be either cultivated locally or transported in amphoras (Banducci, 2019, p. 40). While hazelnuts are an indigenous plant that often grows as a shrub, walnuts and chestnuts are often used as indicators of human management of forests (Mercuri et al., 2013). Pollen evidence indicates that the cultivation of both Juglans and Castanea expanded in the Roman West (Krebs et al., 2022; Pollegioni et al., 2017). While Pliny seemed to favour the medicinal aspects of walnuts (Casas-Agustench et al., 2011; Murphy, 2015, p. 99), the plant was likely used for food and was indeed considered a delicacy (Brothwell and Brothwell, 1998, p. 150). Our results confirm that nuts were especially found as part of ritual offerings, but also in urban markets and in rural villas in the Roman period. Instead, in the post-classical phases they are mainly presents in fortified sites and then similarly present across other site types. Although our research does not involve anthracological remains, it is important to note that nut trees were also cultivated for their timber. Timber held significant economic value in the Roman world and later, as it was used for buildings, fuel, and other purposes (Harris, 2017, p. 228; 2013; Meiggs, 1983).\nIt is amply documented how during the early Middle Ages chestnuts gained popularity in the Italian landscape. The history of the introduction of sweet chestnuts in Italy is interesting and deserves a separate assessment. The fruit was certainly known to Romans, and it is found sporadically in archaeobotanical assemblages from this period. Examples in this database are the villa of Vada Sabatia (Liguria) in archaeological layers dated between the 1st and 2nd century, and the 2nd and 3rd century CE (Arobba et al., 2013), or the necropolis of Mariano Comense (Lombardy) in the stratigraphy from the 1st century BCE to the 3rd century CE (Rottoli and Castiglioni, 2011). However, it seems that the intensification of the cultivation of this tree, planted in large forests, is most likely a post-Roman phenomenon (Conedera et al., 2004a, 2004b; Quirós Castillo, 1998). Squatriti (2016, 2013) in particular has studied the spread of the chestnut in both northern and southern Italy, tracing the origins of the reinforcement of the close relationship between this tree and man since late antiquity. This relationship was still quite strong in the peninsula in the last century, as the chestnut made a substantial contribution to the diet of alpine and mountain communities (Bevilacqua, 1981; Casanova and Sorbetti Guerri, 2007; Ferrari, 2023, pp. 76, 122; Nanni et al., 2005), and even today this fruit is particularly appreciated in the autumn months in Italy.\nIn Chapter 2, we discussed how chestnuts became an integral part of the diet in the early Middle Ages. The fruits were often dried and ground to produce a flour that could be used to make bread, which was less nutritious than bread made from cereals, but still had some nutritional value. Although chestnuts are occasionally mentioned in agricultural contracts (Andreolli, 1990, 1989, 1981), their increased use is a sign of a subsistence economy in which people exploited the land and resources close to them. The “Italians” of the early Middle Ages made great use of wooded areas. As we shall discuss shortly, in this period pigs were more likely to be reared in woods than in enclosures. For example, chestnut groves were introduced around the fortified village and castle of Miranduolo (Tuscany), where the tree was exploited for both wood and for its fruit in the 10th century CE (Buonincontri et al., 2017, p. 667; Buonincontri et al., 2015). Chestnuts are rarely preserved in archaeobotanical contexts, and consequently the species is underrepresented. Despite this bias, our results showed a marked increase in the presence of chestnuts in the 9th century. This is consistent with the current historical understanding of a subsistence economy that relied to a great extent on forest resources."

    "text": "9.2 Animal husbandry\nThe most common faunal remains in the 1st century CE assemblages are cattle, sheep/goats, and pigs, which are present in all the sites investigated. Occasionally, the assemblages also include other species such as domestic poultry and other birds, fish, game animals, and marine or terrestrial molluscs. Overall, the data models consistently indicate a marked preference for medium-sized animals throughout the millennium, with pigs emerging as the most prevalent domesticated species in all phases.\nOf the four primary domesticated species, pigs are unique in that they were primarily used as a source of meat with no significant by-products or secondary functions during their lifetime. In contrast, cattle and sheep/goats were raised for multiple purposes beyond meat production. Cattle, in particular, were an integral part of pre-modern agricultural systems, primarily as draft animals, with some authors associating cattle husbandry with an economy predominantly focused on cereal production (Salvadori, 2019, p. 39). For this reason, cattle were usually butchered at a later stage. In an initial survey of Roman sites in Italy, (MacKinnon, 2004; 2004, pp. 79–80) reported that most cattle remains in both urban and rural contexts showed signs of slaughter after 3.5 years.\nApart from cattle, sheep and goats were also raised for the production of milk and wool. These animals were the primary source of milk in both classical antiquity and the medieval period, although milk consumption by adults was likely rare due to its association with infant nutrition. In turn, cheese was very popular in antiquity, as this was a convenient method of preserving milk (Caruso, 2015; MacKinnon, 2019; Montanari, 2000; Pantaleone da Confienza, 1990).\nTo comprehend why these four animal species were so prevalent, it is necessary to examine the archaeological contexts from which our data are derived. Much like the palaeobotanical assemblages previously discussed, the zooarchaeological data mostly refers to human activities (and waste) rather than natural deposition patterns. This focus unavoidably affects the reported abundance of certain species, as these contexts are more indicative of human consumption and activities rather than reflecting the actual populations of animals in the wild.\nIn Chapter 2 we have stated that the data available for the peninsula are limited both geographically and temporally. Spatially, we can see a preferential distribution of sites along the Thyrrenian coast and parts of northern Italy. In particular, there are large concentrations of assemblages in the Rome-Ostia area. The chronological distribution of the sites is more even, with the late Roman phase being the most represented and the 11th century phase being the least represented.\nNo comprehensive databases containing data from this region and time period were available when this research began. This section will compare our findings with those of previous publications (De Grossi Mazzorin and Minniti, 2022; Rottoli, 2014; Salvadori, 2015; Salvadori, 2019, 2011; Schmidtova et al., 2023), in order to analyse and interpret the identified trends.\n\n9.2.1 Pigs\nIn accordance with the findings from the RomAniDat dataset (Schmidtova et al., 2023), our analysis reveals a notable predominance of pig remains during the first centuries of our investigation, with an increase continuing until the 2nd century CE. This trend is observed predominantly in southern-central Italy, especially in coastal and plain areas, while higher altitudes showed a predominance of sheep, goats, and cattle. This rise in pig remains likely reflects the growing demands of urban markets, corresponding with the demographic peak of the Roman age during the 1st and 2nd centuries CE (Frier, 2000; Hanson, 2016). The demographic growth’s impact was particularly pronounced in Rome, as already highlighted by De Grossi Mazzorin and Minniti (2022, p. 38), who observed a peak in the proportion of pig remains during the Imperial age.\nThis phenomenon begs the question - why is an increase in the number of pigs associated with the demographic situation? Pigs are one of the most practical choices for protein production. Although cattle are the most productive animals on a farm in terms of meat yield, they can only produce one calf every nine months. Sows, on the other hand, can produce eight or more piglets in about four months (Harris, 1998, p. 67). Taking this into account, De Grossi Mazzorin and Minniti (2022, p. 39) have calculated (using modern zootechnic standards) that a cow can produce an average of 15.5 kg of meat in one month, while a sow can produce about 160 kg.\nTo substantiate the association between pigs and demography, and further understand the capital’s influence on this urban trend in pig consumption, we modelled separately data from urban sites and from Rome and Ostia specifically. The results were informative, showing a substantial impact of the capital’s assemblages on overall urban estimates, with a greater than 0.20 point difference in pig remains in the Roman period, narrowing in later periods. In contrast, the same differences are negative in the sheep/goats and cattle models, suggesting that these animals were more commonly found in smaller settlements rather than Rome. Within Rome, the assemblages from the Flavium Amphitheatre are particularly striking, as the waste here mainly consisted of pig remains.\nThe consumption of pork was also high among the villas, mirroring the urban trend. Within these properties, it is probable that pigs were bred on-site rather than being imported. In the late Republican and early Imperial period, it was indeed desirable for villas to maintain their original functions of agricultural production, while other displays of wealth that were deemed unproductive were disapproved of by writers such as Varro (Marzano and Métraux, 2018, p. 10). As they cultivated profitable crops, Roman villas also dedicated significant attention to livestock raising. MacKinnon (2001, p. 665) already highlighted that the most concrete archaeological evidence for a pigsty from the Roman period in Italy is found at the renowned villa of Settefinestre. This site is particularly significant due to the discovery of a structure with 27 rooms identified as a sty, demonstrating a sophisticated level of organised animal husbandry (Ricci, 1985). To our knowledge, this is still the only safe identification. In the words of MacKinnon (2001, p. 665):\n\n“One problem is that the function of many rooms cannot always be determined on the basis of available archaeological and architectural evidence. Often the designation of ‘stable’, ‘pen’, ‘sty’, and so forth is based chiefly on the position and dimensions of the room or structure in relation to other rooms, and not on zooarchaeological, botanical, entomological, or other biological, chemical, or geomorphological evidence that might help indicate the room’s inhabitants”.\n\nAt the start of the late Roman period, there appears to have been a decline in pig farming. This research showed how the drop was particularly evident in urban sites, whereas rural sites only experienced a slight decline. Along with other urban sites, pork consumption decreased also in Rome. Biometric studies examining pig remains in the capital indicate that their sizes increased during this period, potentially due to pigs being reared locally in an open environment (i.e. forests) rather than imported, resulting in a larger size (Albarella et al., 2019; De Grossi Mazzorin, 2016; De Grossi Mazzorin and Minniti, 2001; Minniti, 2016; Minniti and Abatino, 2022).\nIn contrast to this trend, rural villas showed an increase in production. A notable example is the villa of San Giovanni di Ruoti (Basilicata), which was constructed in the early imperial period but abandoned in the 3rd century CE. During the 5th century, the villa underwent a significant expansion and renovation, exhibiting characteristics common to the late antique villa revival trend including an apsidal hall, a large dining room and other luxurious rooms (Small and Tarlano, 2016). This revival was particularly evident in regions such as northern Apulia, Lucania, Sannio, and Sicily (cf. Chapter 2). In San Giovanni, a substantial quantity of pig remains were discovered in the zooarchaeological assemblage dating from the 5th to 6th century. Here, the culling of the herd was carried out in an organized and planned manner, as indicated by the kill-off patterns (MacKinnon, 2002). This breeding strategy is consistent with the hypothesis (Barnish, 1987, p. 159; Steele, 1983) that the villa may have been involved in the late antique pork supply chain, serving urban centres and Rome. In fifth-century Rome, the requirements of the pork dole, which is thought to have been first introduced into the state distribution system by the Emperor Aurelian (Erdkamp, 2013, p. 267), were considerable, requiring the provision of around 25,000 pigs from the southern regions in 419 CE, rising to over 30,000 by 452 CE (Barnish, 1987, pp. 160–2).\nThe high demand for pork extended beyond urban centres. The establishment of a new network of castra in the Alps suggests a substantial requirement for pig meat, in addition to sheep and goats, which already had a longstanding presence in the Alpine region (Riedel, 1994; Riedel and Tecchiati, 2001; Tecchiati, 2010). This increased demand was likely driven by the provisioning needs of the military garrisons stationed there. For instance, archaeological findings at the castrum of Monte Barro in Lombardy reveal that 49% of the faunal remains from the 5th-6th century were pig bones (Baker, 1991). The greater concentration of pig, poultry and fish remains in the palace area than in the rest of the settlement reinforces the idea of an elite consumption of these resources (Chavarría Arnau and Lewit, 2017, p. 164). Similarly, excavations at the castrum of Loppio in Alto Adige/Südtirol, dating to the same period, reported a composition of 34% pig remains and 29% sheep/goat remains (Marconi et al., 2010). The trend becomes more evident in the later stages, especially as more sites are fortified. This is clear from the dataset, which shows a significant rise in the number of such elite settlements.\nThe culmination of this development is observed in the 10th-11th centuries, coinciding with the peak of the incastellamento phenomenon. It is also worth adding that in the early Middle Ages, pork – and meat in general – evolved into a distinct symbol of social status. In a culture where the elite were closely associated with a military persona, the image of a warrior deriving strength from meat consumption held significant symbolic power in demonstrating wealth (Montanari, 2015a, p. 60). The preferential consumption of pork was also prevalent in other fortified settlements throughout Europe, such as those in the Basque Country (Lubritto et al., 2017; Quirós Castillo, 2020; 2016, p. 322), southern France (Durand et al., 1997), Belgium/Netherlands (Vanpoucke et al., 2007), and Poland (Jarczyk et al., 2011). An exception to this trend is early medieval Sicily, where pork does not seem to feature in the diet of castra sites, even during the Norman/Aragonese period. This could be attributed to the persistence of Islamised communities (Aniceti and Albarella, 2022).\nHistorians have placed particular emphasis on the consumption of pork in their historical reconstruction of the diet and agricultural practices of the early Middle Ages in Italy. The swine explosion of this period was unprecedented— pigs were in every cookbook, they appeared in laws, forests were measured by the number of pigs they could host, and the swineherd became one of the most respected Lombard serfs (Montanari, 1988, pp. 57–8). Pig also became a Christian marker in this time, contrasting the Jewish and Muslim diet (Montanari, 2015b, pp. 143–144).\nOur findings provide a contrasting view to the commonly accepted historical narrative regarding pork consumption trends during the early Middle Ages. First, a macroscopic view of the data indicates a decrease in overall pig meat consumption compared to the Roman period. While there was a revival of pig meat consumption in the 8th century, and the 9th century’s estimated mean approaches that of the Imperial period, the overall probability of pigs occurrence in the early medieval assemblages remains lower than those dated to the Roman age. Second, a distinct trend is observable when comparing rural and urban sites. During the early Middle Ages, rural sites record more frequent instances of pig remains than in the Roman period. Conversely, urban sites demonstrate a general decline in pork consumption until the 11th century, which plausibly reflects demographic changes. Third, it is possible that the overarching historical and archaeological narrative has been shaped principally by northern Italian sources3. This is evident in the macroregional trends: up until the 11th century, the assemblages from central and southern Italy demonstrate clear negative trends in pig remains, in contrast to the north, which shows a marked increase.\nThe impact of Germanic culture on pig farming and consumption patterns in northern Italy was likely one of the relevant factors in this increase. Germanic societies - whose nourishment mainly consisted of meat - held certain myths revolving around pigs, for example, the “Great Pig” that soldiers cooked and ate daily, only to see it reborn the following day (Montanari, 2015a, pp. 165–8). Norse mythology describes Gullinbursti, a mythological boar associated with fertility, capable of outrunning any other animal and shining in the darkness (Sturluson, 1916, pp. 145–6). The division between humans and nature dissolved as forests ceased to hinder economic development and instead became beneficial resources: one innovation of the early Middle Ages was the practice of rearing pigs in woodland areas, where they could subsist on acorns from oak groves (silva glandifera) (Montanari, 2015a, p. 164; Wickham, 1994, p. 184). In the Alpine region, this fact is supported archaeologically via isotope analyses of pig bones originating from the Adige Valley (Paladin et al., 2020). In describing the spread of pigs in the early medieval West, Kreiner (2020, p. 78) makes a good point:\n\n“[…] it was possible to raise a pig almost anywhere, as long as an adequate supply of water was available. This made pigs a good investment, because in almost any ecology, the animals could reliably transform resources that humans would not otherwise use (acorns, grubs, household garbage; the list goes on) into energy they could use. By some calculations, over 80 percent of a pig’s weight amounted to edible, meaty energy—so even the leaner, active pigs of Late Antiquity and the early Middle Ages could have produced approximately 100–175 pounds (or 50–80 kg) of pork and lard.”\n\nThis less intensive approach to pig rearing likely indicates a form of non-specialised farming, where the meat produced was intended primarily for local consumption (Chavarría et al., 2016, p. 136). It must also be noted that pork could easily be stored for longer periods if kept in a cold and damp room, or in the snow (André, 2009, p. 141).\nOverall, the results suggest that pork was the most consumed source of meat protein during the first millennium. However, pig rearing varied during this period, ranging from intensive, specialised rearing for urban meat markets in the Roman period to less specialised and localised rearing strategies in the early medieval period. The historical literature has overestimated the increasing importance of pigs in the early medieval Italian diet: pork consumption did increase, but only in northern Italy.\n\n\n9.2.2 Cattle\nIn contrast to pigs, cattle show the lowest distribution among the four main domesticated species throughout the first millennium CE. While modelling the NISP counts does not consider that a single cow yields considerably more meat than pigs or sheep/goats, rearing cattle exclusively for meat production was not the most profitable farming option, as previously discussed. Indeed, Roman agricultural practices often prioritized the use of cattle for draft work and dairy production, rather than exclusively for meat. This approach is evident in historical texts: Columella, for example, highlighted the significance of rearing oxen for field labour, whilst Varro broadened the scope to encompass dairy operations (Ikeguchi, 2017, p. 31). Moreover, analysis of the kill-off patterns for Roman Italy indicates that cattle were predominantly slaughtered at an older age, a stage when the quality of the meat would not be at its prime (MacKinnon, 2004, pp. 79–80). The important role of cattle in Roman agriculture is underlined by zooarchaeological evidence suggesting a specialisation in cattle rearing. In particular, an increase in the height and width of these animals was observed, particularly between the Republican and Imperial periods (De Grossi Mazzorin and Minniti, 2022; MacKinnon, 2010). Recent scholarly debates, however, have re-examined the extent and nature of this Roman specialisation. While the domestication of animals since prehistoric times is generally associated with a gradual reduction in size (Meadow, 1989), recent research suggests that the improvement of breeding strategies in Italy may have begun before the establishment of Roman dominance in the peninsula. This perspective is supported by the work of Trentacoste et al. (2021, 2018), who analysed log standard index (LSI) values and mandibular third molars (M3s) from different sites in northern Italy. Their findings suggest a trend towards increasing bovine size from the Bronze Age to the Roman period, challenging the traditional understanding of the Roman influence on cattle breeding and domestication.\nCattle sizes seem to have differed across the peninsula. In a paper where he compared literary evidence with zooarchaeological data, MacKinnon (2010) tried to establish the presence of different varieties of cattle in Roman Italy. Overall, both textual and zooarchaeological evidence confirmed that northern Italian cattle was smaller in size than central and southern Italian ‘breeds’. While this research cannot contribute to the debate on cattle sizes, it can discuss its abundance. Both MacKinnon (2004) and Schmidtova et al. (2023) indicate that (despite the smaller size), cattle was indeed more abundant in the northern part of Italy. Our results confirm this trend, indicating much higher proportions than elsewhere. Our results confirm this trend, indicating significantly higher proportions in the north compared to other regions. Looking at the macroscopic trend, the model suggests a decline in cattle numbers during the Roman period until the 3rd century CE, followed by a subsequent increase, which is more evident in rural sites. This increase, which is particularly marked in the north, reinforces the region’s inclination towards livestock farming. The upward trend in northern Italy is particularly striking because it precedes a marked decline in the early medieval period, a pattern not observed in other Italian regions. During this phase, the overall presence of cattle appears to increase, peaking in the 6th-7th centuries CE, especially in the central and southern regions. Valenti (2017, p. 141) has suggested that the most striking changes in landscape and settlement patterns during this period (particularly in the Lombard sphere of influence) can be seen in new forms of rural landscape, mainly based on fallow land and animal husbandry. Paleopathological analyses of human remains from established Lombard cemeteries dating from the 6th and 7th centuries also support the idea of a class of farmers and shepherds among the Lombard groups. In Collegno (Piedmont), Spilamberto (Emilia-Romagna) and Leno (Lombardy), in addition to elite burials, many skeletons show pathologies associated with intense labour (Valenti, 2017, pp. 141–2). The peak in the 6th and 7th centuries contrasts with the results of a previous study by Salvadori (2011), who dated a decline in both the population and size of cattle during this period. Instead, our results suggest that the most significant shifts in cattle husbandry occurred around the 8th century CE, possibly linked to broader agrarian transformations. Cattle farming did not disappear from northern Italy. Interestingly, despite the decline in this area, our models suggest that the distribution of cattle in the early medieval period was relatively uniform across the peninsula. Furthermore, compared to the previous phase, there are no major changes in the distribution of cattle between different settlement types, suggesting a continuity in cattle management practices between urban and rural environments. Complicating the interpretation of these trends, the 8th and 9th centuries exhibit the highest variability within the dataset. While the estimated mean precision (\\(\\phi\\)) for both centuries is acceptable, there is a notable spread in these estimates. This indicates considerable variability within the groups, suggesting that a larger sample size might be necessary for more precise conclusions. This dispersion in the assemblages these centuries is informative in itself. The lack of cohesion in the data could imply that farming strategies during these centuries were more localised and varied, rather than following a uniform, widespread pattern. This variation could reflect a shift towards more region-specific agricultural practices, possibly influenced by the differing socio-economic conditions across the peninsula.\nThe decline in the size and number of cattle during the post-classical period has elicited various explanations from scholars. Salvadori (2019, p. 39; 2011) associates Roman and late Roman cattle farming almost exclusively with agricultural systems. As previously discussed, pigs were the preferred source of meat, with cattle being more closely linked with extensive grain production. According to Salvadori, a reduction in cattle numbers implied that the agrarian system was more based on smaller farming operations at this point. Other scholars, however, argue that the early medieval shift to pastoralism in some areas of the western Mediterranean involved using cattle and sheep/goats primarily for dairy production. In fact, although cattle was smaller in size, this would not have impacted its milk-producing capacity (Chavarría Arnau and Lewit, 2021, p. 11; 2017, pp. 163–4). A combination of these two hypotheses is plausible. Firstly, it is possible that early medieval mixed cereal and vegetable production focused on yield rather than quality, especially for smallholders, thereby requiring less labour-intensive cattle use. Secondly, promoting cheese production could have been a strategic move during times of uncertainty, providing a long-lasting and reliable source of protein.\nFollowing this declining phase, cattle becomes more frequent in the zooarchaeological assemblages. Although the estimates for this period are more uncertain due to a smaller sample size, the general trend appears positive in 10th-11th centuries. Also in this phase the context specific models do not reveal a significant effect size, with the most notable change being observed in religious sites. Despite this, it is clear that beef was not the preferred meat in monastic and religious contexts. The proportions of beef compared to pork are considerably lower in each site. For example, at the Farfa abbey, the 8th-9th century assemblages predominantly contain pig remains (51%), followed by sheep/goats (32%), with cattle only comprising 10%. This pattern persists into a later phase (10th-12th century), with similar distributions (64% pigs, 30% sheep/goats, 5% cattle). Additionally, we explored whether assemblages from Rome influenced the estimates for urban sites overall. It was found that cattle were more prevalent in smaller urban communities, which might have engaged in agricultural activities in their surrounding areas, compared to Rome. The increase in cattle remains in the 10th-11th century contexts aligns with archaeobotanical data indicating a more widespread presence of cereals and legumes during this time.\nThe distribution of cattle remains is not only linked to socio-economic events: in any phase, the geographical context plays a crucial role. The elevation models show a definite correlation between cattle presence and altitude, suggesting that environmental factors significantly influenced livestock farming practices.\n\n\n9.2.3 Sheep and goats\nSheep and goats were the second most bred animal category during the 1st millennium CE, according to zooarchaeological samples. In excavation reports, distinguishing between them is often complicated, hence why they are frequently listed as a single category due to the absence of crucial skeletal elements for identification. Rearing these animals has several benefits since they provide meat, milk, other dairy products, leather, and most importantly wool. In classical antiquity, the benefits of sheep farming for agriculture were well-recognized, with ancient writers extolling the virtues of natural sheep manure as a fertilizer (Gallo, 1999, p. 41). In return for the array of benefits they provide, they require fresh fodder, which they typically obtain through grazing in pastures (Bonetto, 2004).\nThe historical discourse on animal husbandry during and after the first millennium has often focused significantly on sheep and goats, particularly due to their association with transhumance. This phenomenon involves the seasonal migration of livestock from lower winter pastures to higher summer pastures, and it continues to be relevant in Italy today to a lesser extent. While our models, based on NISP data, may not directly contribute to this debate, they can serve as a valuable complementary source. Therefore, a significant portion of this section will be devoted to examining transhumance, with a particular focus on Apulia, where much of the scholarly discussion has been concentrated to date. Additionally, this section will interpret the broader trends in the occurrence of sheep and goats across the various contexts in our database.\nBased on the chronological trends revealed by our models, clear patterns emerge in the distribution of caprine remains. From the 1st century BCE, there is a marked decline, continuing until the 4th century CE. This pattern is also observed by Schmidtova et al. (2023). At this point, a sharp reversal occurs, with an increase that persists until the 7th-8th centuries. Subsequently, there appears to be a slower decline. These findings are in line with Salvadori (2019), who also identified a turning point around the 9th century and a subsequent increase in the 10th-12th centuries. The latter is not evident from our samples, which extend up to the 11th century. Like cattle, the 8th and 9th centuries are characterised by the broadest credible intervals for sheep and goats, partially due to a smaller number of zooarchaeological assemblages from this period and to a higher variability between samples.\nWhile the trends we have observed offer a broad overview at the peninsular level, the picture complicates when we stratify the models by macroareas, revealing differing regional patterns. In southern Italy, the trends closely align with the overall peninsular estimates. Central Italy follows similar patterns at least until the end of the 10th century. The most striking contrasts are to be found in northern Italy. Here, the data reveals a contrasting narrative showing decline in the population of sheep and goats over the course of the millennium with a subsequent increase around the year 1000.\nWhen stratifying by context type, the most trustworthy trends (in terms of the credible intervals) are those for rural and urban sites. Sheep and goats remains appear to decline over time after the Roman period in rural farms, while they increase in the assemblages from urban settlements. Later, around the 11th century, there appears to be a stabilisation in the curve in urban sites and an increase in rural sites. With this recall of our results in hand, let us now try to provide interpretations to these trends.\nA large sector of the Roman economy was dedicated to textile manufacturing, with some areas in particular that were famous for the quality of their wool: Cisalpine Gaul (northern Italy), southern Gaul, and Apulia. Most ancient authors reference to large productions in cities as Altinum, Parma, Mutina, and the area around the river Scultenna (presently referred to as Scoltenna), with the municipium of Patavium (modern-day Padua) likely serving as a major coordinating centre for these activities (Corti, 2012; Cottica, 2003; Moeller, 1976; Vicari, 2001, 1994). Other authors, as Martial (Ep. 14.155), ranked the wool from Apulia as the one with the finest quality (Liu, 2013, pp. 128–9). Within Apulia, Tarentum (Taranto) and Canusium (Canosa) were renowned for their wool economies. Two imperial textile workshops (gynecia), in particular, were active during the Late Antique period in Canosa and the nearby city of Venosa (Basilicata) (Grelle and Silvestrini, 2001; Vera, 2005; Volpe, 1996, pp. 281–2).\nApulia’s geographical advantage as the endpoint of a winter transhumance route also meant it had access to wool from spring shearing before the flocks moved to summer pastures (Flohr, 2016). Post-shearing, the wool was processed and spun in specialised textile workshops. There is ample debate (Flohr, 2016, 2011; Liu, 2013) about whether raw wool was processed locally or transported to larger workshops, such as those in Pompeii (Flohr, 2013) or central Italy (Jongman, 2000), for processing. This research does not delve into this debate, as our data does not contribute directly to it. However, our findings do reinforce the hypothesis of the presence of strong wool production centres both in the south and north of Roman Italy, and the spatial models in Schmidtova et al. (2023) seem to indicate clusters around the Po Valley and Apulia.\nSheep and goat rearing was undoubtedly a profitable activity, but our analyses suggest that it is unlikely that rural villa economies in the Roman period and beyond were specialised in sheep husbandry. Pigs were consistently the most important livestock on large estates. It is reasonable to assume that sheep and goats were kept for their manure, which was beneficial to the farms, or for their secondary products. In contrast, these animals were more common on smaller farms, which may have practised mixed farming already in Roman times, as suggested by botanical evidence. Roman farmers were aware that animal husbandry was one of the most lucrative aspects of the agricultural economy (Hollander, 2019, pp. 63–64; Kron, 2000). While smaller farmers may have engaged in convertible husbandry, the Roman elite likely directed their efforts towards the transhumant wool market. In the 2nd century CE, even the emperor owned a flock of sheep at Saepinum (Corbier, 1983). Later Roman administrations continued to support pastoral practices, although not as extensively as in the late Middle Ages, when this investment was at the expense of other agricultural sectors (Barker, 1989, pp. 13–14).\nThe existing literature on wool production and transhumance, particularly in southern regions like Apulia, indicates a crisis in the wool market between the 4th and 6th centuries CE. This crisis paralleled the decline of the imperial textile industry, which peaked in the 5th century and was exacerbated by the broader administrative crisis of the empire (Giardina, 1989, p. 98; Grelle, 1986). In fact, a significant portion of the imperial demand for wool had traditionally been driven by the army and the administrative machinery. During this period, while Apulian wheat production was highly regarded in literary sources, shepherds were often depicted as troublesome, almost bandit-like figures (Volpe, 1996, pp. 276–285; 1992, pp. 72–85).\nThe growth of cereal cultivation in the south in this period is supported by our botanical models, which show a particular focus on free-threshing wheats and barley. De Robertis (1972; 1951, pp. 47–48) initially argued that this shift towards cereal farming eventually led to the decline of the investments in animal husbandry, suggesting that competition for arable land disadvantaged sheep and goat rearing. However, this somewhat pessimistic view was later revised by other scholars who deemed a complete collapse of all pastoral activities, including private ones, as unlikely. Various historical documents and epigraphs suggest that sheep/goats farming continued into the 6th century, supported by various documents and epigraphs (Grelle, 2001, p. 654; 1986, pp. 391–2; Vera, 2002; Volpe, 1992).\nWhile our models suggest a decline in the number of sheep and goats in the north, southern models indicate an increase in caprine abundance. In many of the southern Italian assemblages from the early medieval period, sheep and goats are the most represented category. We must therefore agree with those who question the idea of a total collapse of pastoral activities, assuming that cereal and livestock farming could be coexisting industries (Pasquinucci, 2004, p. 170; Volpe, 2023; 1996, p. 285). What is more plausible, is that the transhumance system underwent a transformation between late antiquity and the early middle ages.\nThe data from several sites included in our database, and others historically associated with the great Roman transhumance routes, offer important insights for reconstructing past practices.\nAt the site of San Giusto in Apulia, part of a large imperial estate (saltus Carminianensis), evidence extends beyond zooarchaeological findings to demonstrate the site’s pastoral vocation, persisting into the early Middle Ages. Skeletal studies suggest that the site was probably associated to pastoral activities and the use of uncultivated land during the 5th-7th centuries. In fact, one of the skeletons exhibited signs of brucellosis, a disease contracted through the consumption of infected dairy products or through contact with animals (Buglione et al., 2015; Sublimi Saponetti et al., 2005).\nAt the nearby former Roman villa of Faragola, which in the early medieval period was likely a Lombard curtis, faunal remains predominantly represent sheep and goat farming in the 6th and 8th centuries. This marked a change from the previous phase of occupation (4th-5th centuries), when most of the animal remains found in the villa were of pigs (Buglione, 2007, 2006).\nIn the same period, wither height measurements from various contexts in northern Apulia, including San Giusto, Faragola, and Herdonia, suggest that caprine measurements increased (average wither height = 67 cm), and these were possibly part of extensive flocks, likely grazed in uncultivated areas (Volpe et al., 2012, p. 254).\nThe continuity of stable wool production is also supported by the faunal assemblage from the Byzantine phase of the villa in loc. Vassarella-Casino Vezzani di Crecchio, Abruzzo (6th-7th century CE). Although very informative, being located on a transhumant route from Abruzzo to Apulia, this settlement was not included in our database due to the absence of raw data in the publication (De Grossi Mazzorin, 1993). Along the same route, the 6th-9th century assemblage from Santa Maria in Cività in the Biferno Valley, Molise, reported that over 50% of the total NISP were sheep and goat bones (Hodges et al., 1980).\nTowards the end of the early medieval period (8th-10th century), bioarchaeological data from two contexts in Canosa (San Pietro and San Giovanni) continue to show markers of caprine breeding for wool production, even when sheep and goats appear to be in decline in other Italian contexts (Buglione, 2006, pp. 503–4; Giuliani and Leone, 2005; Volpe et al., 2012).\nTranshumance in early medieval central Italy, particularly on the Tyrrhenian coast, has been somewhat overlooked in historical discussions. This practice, which involved winter grazing in areas such as southern Tuscany, the Pontine countryside and Viterbo, is documented in the early medieval period in references dating from the mid-8th century (then again in the 9th, 11th-12th). These documents can be found in the records of the Abbey of Farfa (Fara in Sabina, Rieti), which highlight the seasonal migration of livestock through various areas, including the cities of Spoleto, Rieti and Ascoli (Pasquinucci, 2004). This aspect is further developed by Pasquinucci (2021, p. 33; 1990) and Barker et al. (1991, 1988), with Barker et al. (1991) providing an in-depth analysis of pastoralism in the Cicolano Mountains (Rieti). The latter work raises questions about the nature of these livestock movements, in particular their range - whether they were short or long distance migrations. Zooarchaeological remains from the Farfa assemblage in the database confirm the importance of sheep and goats in the area, accounting for over a third of the assemblage (Clark, 1997). This pattern is consistent with evidence from other central Italian sites, although without reaching the higher proportions found in southern Italy during this period.\nThis brief assessment of archaeological and historical literature has pointed out to a decline in transhumance and pastoralism in southern Italy in the early medieval period. This decline has been linked to the collapse of the Apulian textile industry (Volpe, 2010a, 2010b) and, more generally, to the breakdown of the international wool market (Wickham, 1985, p. 432). What happened then in the southern countryside, and how can we instead explain our reported increased abundance of these animals in the early medieval period?\nClementi (1984, pp. 37–40) argued that the Greco-Gothic wars and the change of Lombard administration in the 6th century interrupted the supply of sheep from Abruzzo to Apulia. According to Clementi (1984, p. 37): “transhumance, it is obvious, requires political stability” and this practice must therefore have ceased in this period. It is however difficult to speak of a single form of transhumance in Italy, but rather of a plurality of ‘transhumances’ (cf. Marcone, 2016). In this respect, some authors have argued for a shorter-range transhumance in this period, rather than a complete cessation of pastoral practices. In particular, the early medieval transhumance would have taken the form of a vertical transhumance (alpeggio), from the mountains to the nearest valley, instead of the long-distance journeys typical of the Roman and late medieval periods (Pasquinucci, 2004, p. 167; Volpe, 1996; 1992, p. 95; Wickham, 1982).\nRather than thinking in dualistic terms about the debate between continuity and rupture, it would be more productive to rethink the very concept of transhumance and its forms. In addition to historical sources, our models are helpful in the assessment of the animal population trends. First, the modelled distribution of animal remains indicate that, after the Roman period, sheep and goats became gradually more common in southern Italian sites. These models do not describe the full life history of such mobile animals – this would require isotopic studies – but they do indicate where animals have been culled. Secondly, our altimetric models show interesting patterns in the distribution of caprine animals at different elevations. While in the Roman and late Roman periods sheep and goats are mostly killed at higher altitudes, later there seems to be an opposite trend.\nIn general, the transhumance practice concentrates lambing in the late autumn and winter so that the lambs can be slaughtered before the flocks move to higher summer pastures and the surplus meat can be distributed to markets (Volpe et al., 2012, p. 250). Could the greater presence of sheep and goats in lowland areas at this time therefore indicate a reorganisation of production and transhumance practices?\nIf we agree with Clementi (1984), and Abruzzo indeed ceased to be the main supplier of sheep and goats to Apulia in the 6th century, but wool production continued (albeit to a lesser extent), Apulia had to reorganise its stock raising activities in order to have access to raw material. We suggest then that the increased archaeological evidence for sheep and goats in the south is indicative of sedentary caprine farming and a consequent necessity for a – more local – reorganisation.\nWe cannot however estimate whether the actual number of sheep/goats passing through the region in the early medieval period was lower compared to the numbers guaranteed by the larger-scale Roman transhumance; for this estimation, we would need records which are not available. This supposition is however likely, since the demand for wool reduced after the political breakdown of the empire. What we can do with our models is provide scenarios for the reconstruction of the farming landscape, which saw an increased presence of sheep and goats alongside cereal fields. Sedentary caprine husbandry required the presence of uncultivated pastures, which are known from pollen data (Accorsi et al., 1995). Moreover, if transhumance was practiced at this time – in an landscape increasingly dedicated to cereals – it must have been short-distance with herds moving to close by mountains or available fallow land (Pasquinucci 2004, 167).\nA recent multi-isotopic analysis of faunal remains from an imperial site in the Basentello Valley, Vagnari (Puglia), indirectly provides further support to our hypothesis (Trentacoste et al., 2023). Situated near the Appian Way and adjacent to the historic transhumance routes between Lucania and the Murge, this site has long been associated with large-scale transhumance activities (Small et al., 2003). Instead, the new evidence from the estate suggests that the animals unearthed at the site were present throughout the year, with no discernible signs of seasonal migration to different ecological zones. These findings imply that if Vagnari was indeed involved in large-scale transhumance, these migratory flocks were kept separate from the local herd, which instead contributed to the agricultural activities and to the local demand for wool, dairy products and meat. Furthermore, the absence of long-distance transhumant sheep confirms that these were slaughtered at higher altitudes during the Roman period.\nThe Apulian herds increased in number after the Roman period, probably to fill the gap left by the cessation of long-distance transhumance. Much later, the phenomenon of transhumance in Apulia would grow and become increasingly structured, with the establishment in 1447 of the Regia dogana della mena delle pecora di Puglia by Alfonso I of Aragon (Licinio, 1998). In the late 17th century, around five and a half million sheep were involved in the central-southern Apennines transhumance (Garnsey, 1998, p. 199). At the same time of the institution of the Dogana, the papal state also organised itself on the Aragonese model to regularise the transit of flocks in the 15th century in central Italy (Conti, 1982; Mengarelli, 2010).\nThe number of studies on sheep/goat farming in northern Italy is much more limited than for Abruzzo and northern Apulia. Our models clearly show a downward trend, at least until the 11th century, probably linked to the rapid expansion of pig farming in the early Middle Ages. Whilst sheep and goats appear in agricultural documents and contracts from the Po area and Tuscany in the 7th and 8th centuries (Galetti, 1993, pp. 50–2), they certainly played a marginal role in the economy compared to the large-scale wool production of Cisalpina in Roman times. The amount of uncultivated land available for pastoral activities in the north increased in this period (Varanini and Demo, 2012, p. 305), but in the absence of other documents, and reflecting back on our palaeobotanical evidence, the agricultural economy here seems to be more related to a subsistence one. It is only in the 12th and 13th centuries that historical sources suggest a reorganisation of production in the wool sector, especially in Veneto (Varanini and Demo, 2012).\n\n\n9.2.4 Other animals\nIn addition to the main four domesticates, excavation reports include a wider range of domesticated and consumed animals, such as birds, fish, horses, terrestrial and marine molluscs, and various wild fauna (venison, boar, hare, dormouse). These species are often rare or under-represented in archaeological finds, and thus require separately designed analyses.\nAlthough our research focused on the main domesticated animals – as they have a more substantial impact on the reconstruction of ancient husbandry practices – in this section we offer overall chronological trends and interpretations for two categories of interest, namely domestic poultry and game animals. Despite the limits in our interpretations, it was important to build a comprehensive database that reflected the diversity of ancient Italian diets, while also providing a valuable resource for other scholars, enabling further research.\nDuring the first millennium CE, domestic fowl, primarily chicken (Gallus gallus) and to a lesser extent goose (Anser sp.), were likely the fourth most commonly consumed meat source, according to our database. Our analysis of domestic fowl has solely concentrated on their chronological distribution in zooarchaeological assemblages. We did not build models that included other predictors (i.e. site type, macroregion, etc.) because of the risks related to subsetting datasets that contain rarer species. Moreover, birds and fish are subject to further bias, as they are severely under-represented in excavation reports. This is because smaller bones are harder to visually inspect and require targeted sampling methodologies (cf. Chapter 4).\nOverall, the model indicates a rise in the abundance of poultry in Italy until the 4th century CE. After this period, the consumption of domestic fowl became more popular and the animal was certainly no longer reared solely for ritual purposes. The curve stabilises until the 6th century CE, and rises again during the early medieval period. However, the means are still below a 0.10 probability, meaning that poultry was a marginal contribution to the diet when compared to other meats as pork. Our observed increase in the Roman period is consistent with the findings of De Grossi Mazzorin and Minniti (2022, p. 76), who noted a rise in the diffusion of Gallus in the zooarchaeological assemblages from the city of Rome, which also coincided with an increase in chicken sizes.\nAlthough a controversial topic, recent research on the domestication of chickens suggests that these birds were domesticated around the 6th millennium CE in Southeast Asia, possibly in northern China (Eda et al., 2023; Eda, 2021; Eda et al., 2016). The Gallus species was subsequently introduced to Europe, appearing in the Italian peninsula probably around the 6th-5th centuries BCE. In Italy, chickens were associated with ritual practices (Corbino et al., 2022; Green, 2023, pp. 60–72) and only in the Republican/Imperial periods the primary use of the species shifted to meat and egg (De Grossi Mazzorin, 2000).\nContrasting with De Grossi Mazzorin and Minniti (2022, pp. 83–4), who observed a decline in chicken consumption in early medieval Rome, our models do not indicate a similar trend for the rest of Italy. Instead, they reveal increased variability in the estimated abundances and in the precision of our models, suggesting a more heterogeneous pattern of fowl consumption during this period. Domestic fowl are well suited to urban environments or confined spaces due to their ability to live in smaller areas. They also provide a daily source of small amounts of protein, making them ideal for urban gardens. Despite the relatively low quantity of their bones found in archaeological assemblages, the postclassical increase in chicken consumption is evident in our model, and this interpretation aligns well with the early medieval need to secure food sources in close proximity to living areas.\nGame animals also played a role in the diet, albeit a marginal one. Given the rarity of wild animal bones in the assemblages, the category ‘edible wild animals’ in our models includes more than one species, such as boar (Sus scrofa ferus), red deer (Cervus elaphus), fallow deer (Dama dama), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), various lagomorphs (e.g., Lepus sp.), dormouse (Glis glis), and assorted wild birds (predominantly pheasants, ducks, etc.). Other wild animals including foxes (Vulpes vulpes), dogs (Canis sp.), bears (Ursus arctos), and others were included in the database, but were not modelled.\nIn this section, we will only provide a discussion concerning the role and prevalence of these wild species in the diet. Green (1996), examining Roman documentary sources, recognised that hunting was practised by various members of society for different reasons. Aristocrats would hunt as a sport, soldiers would undertake hunting activities as part of their military training, and people at the margins of society would hunt as a complementary source of food.\nFrom our models, it is however evident how game was not the main source of meat, and in Roman Italy (and also later), subsistence strategies depended on the main domesticated species. These results also confirms previous studies on Roman hunting (Clark, 1997, 1989; MacKinnon, 2006). In every period, the estimated means of wild animal remains consistently remain below a probability level of 0.05, with a slight increase observed from the 7th to the 11th century, particularly in central and northern Italy.\nOur general assessment revealed – although more data is required – that there were no significant differences between urban and rural sites in any chronological period. However, the models predict higher estimates in elite contexts, such as villas and fortified sites. In the Roman period, curiously, religious sites seem to consume more game meat than other settlements, probably as ritual offerings. The association between hunting and elite contexts is also apparent in the hunting scenes depicted in the refined 4th century CE mosaics of the Villa del Casale (Piazza Armerina, Sicily) (Pace, 1955; Steger and Darmon, 2017). When large rural estates gradually lose their elite connotations, the presence of wild fauna declines.\nAccording to historical reconstructions, the early medieval period saw a stronger link between the elite and game consumption. Hunting rights came to be increasingly restricted to the nobility from the 7th century, and even more so around the 9th and 10th centuries (Wickham, 1994, pp. 160–1). In various areas of Italy, game was only reserved for the venationes— hunting trips that defined the aristocratic warrior identity (Montanari, 1999a, pp. 470–1; 1999b, p. 452).\nDespite the fact that we would expect higher game consumption at higher elevations – because we would expect smaller plots and more woodland – our models did not support this correlation. However, the study by Baker (1994) is interesting in this respect. In her work, she examined the distribution of different body parts of wild animals in contexts located at different altitudes in northern Italy. Baker noted that larger species, such as venison, were hunted in the Alps and then brought down to the valleys (e.g. the Po Valley) for further processing, including leather and bone working. We cannot confirm this correlation, as we do not have body parts data, but this is an interesting hypothesis. We must also consider that the early medieval greater prevalence of woodlands in various parts of Italy, must have also facilitated hunting by creating more areas for wild animals to take refuge. The forest advancement is suggested by several sources (Accorsi et al., 1999; Cheyette, 2008, pp. 163–4; Christie, 2006, pp. 487–491; De Majo, 2022, pp. 53–5; Di Pasquale et al., 2014)."

    "text": "9.3 Reconstructing Italian historical landscapes\nNow that we have discussed each of the categories of plants and animals studied in this research, we will try and draw together these sources to provide a more macro-level interpretation. This section will present hypothetical scenarios of the agricultural economy in the four chronological phases relevant to this study.\n\n9.3.1 Roman phase (1st century BCE – 2nd century CE)\nIn the Roman phase (1st century BCE – 2nd century CE), we observed a relative homogeneity in farming practices across the Italian peninsula. The climatic stability of the Roman Warm Period (200 BCE -  200/400 CE ca.) likely contributed to the consistency in agricultural methods, with plants and animals generally adhering to their geographical requirements. Notable differences, on the other hand, are found primarily at the settlement level. Two predominant approaches to agriculture were identified: small-scale farming in minor rural settlements and export-oriented farming in large, high-status estates like rural villas.\nIn the smaller farms, intensive mixed farming was the mainstay. This approach involved cultivating several types of crops, a practice evident throughout Italy, coupled with the presence of livestock. This interpretation aligns with Kron’s historical models (Kron, 2004, 2000), which suggest that Roman farmers were aware of the benefits of convertible husbandry. Ley farming allowed for the efficient use of fallow land as pasture for sheep, goats, and cattle. In turn, these animals played a fundamental role in fertilising the land for subsequent sowing, thereby improving overall productivity. Archaeobotanical assemblages reveal a diversity of crops, implying that polyculture was a common practice in these smaller settlements. Although cereal production remained the backbone of agriculture, olives and grapes were also cultivated in rural sites at a lesser extent than villas. Among the cereals, free-threshing wheats, barley, and emmer were most prevalent, but other cereals were also cultivated. It is plausible, as suggested by Witcher (2016, p. 467), that rural households cultivated different cereals for domestic use and market export. In addition to cereals, the cultivation of legumes was also observed, probably for both human consumption and animal feed. The coexistence of cereals and legumes in the assemblages further supports the hypothesis of a crop rotation system, in line with the concept of convertible husbandry.\nIn contrast to smaller rural settlements, rural villas, representing the larger estates, were inclined towards export-oriented farming and specialised in the production of cash crops such as olives and grapes. Villas also focused on a smaller number of cereals and other crops when compared to other rural settlements. While villas did cultivate cereals and other crops, their variety was typically narrower compared to other rural settlements. Outlining precise agricultural models for villas is challenging when relying solely on presence/absence archaeobotanical data. However, the crop selection in villas seems more compatible with extensive agricultural operations rather than intensive farming. Roman agricultural texts inform us that villas also raised animals, and zooarchaeological assemblages consistently show the presence of the four main domesticates. We can thus hypothesise that villas might have implemented rotation systems, allowing cattle and sheep/goats to graze in pastures. Furthermore, as previously discussed, the raising of caprine might have been a permanent feature of both villas and smaller sites. Recent analyses, such as those carried out in the imperial estates of the Basentello Valley (Trentacoste et al., 2023), together with other historical debates (Garnsey, 1998; Kron, 2002, p. 54), suggest that the modalities of transhumance in Roman Italy may still not be entirely clear.\nThe distribution and abundance of domesticates varied according to the specialisation of different regions in Italy. In the Po Valley, cattle were more commonly raised, while sheep and goats were prevalent in areas involved in wool production. Pig husbandry, however, emerged as a key component of the villa economy across the peninsula. In the north, as seen in Ronchi dei Legionari, Friuli Venezia-Giulia (Petrucci, 2008), and Isera, Trentino Alto-Adige (Riedel and Tecchiati, 2011), pigs and cattle were the principal species. In central Italy, sites like Mola di Monte Gelato (King, 1997), Settefinestre, Tuscany (King, 1985), and Ossaia, Tuscany (Bökönyi, Unpublished), predominantly show evidence of pig farming. In the south, examples from Botromagno, Apulia (Small et al., 1994), and Masseria Ciccotti, Basilicata (Gualtieri et al., 1994) indicate a mix of pigs, cattle, and sheep/goats, particularly in areas involved in wool production. The case of Settefinestre illustrates the significance of pig husbandry in the villa economy, where pig remains are abundant, contrasting with the lesser presence of cattle compared to other rural sites. This disparity further supports the correlation between cereal farming and smaller-scale farming operations.\n\n\n9.3.2 Late Roman period (3rd – 5th century CE)\nA significant change in agricultural strategies began to emerge around the 3rd/4th century CE, marked by geographical differentiation. Large-scale production underwent a reorganisation, with increased variability in cereal cultivation. In southern Italy, there was an increased focus on the cultivation of common Roman cereals such as free-threshing wheats, barley, and emmer. This trend suggests a growing importance of cereal production in these areas during late antiquity, aligning with the historical context discussed earlier. Our results seem to corroborate this emphasis on cereal cultivation in the south during this time. Interestingly, in these regions, there was also a noticeable decline in legume cultivation, further indicating a shift towards more extensive forms of agriculture. In contrast, central and northern Italy experienced an expansion in the cultivation of a broader range of cereal and legume crops. Alongside the main cereals, these regions started growing more rustic grains, with rye standing out in the north. Regional production differences were not only limited to cereal growing. Contrasting trends can also be seen in grape and olive production. In the south, the production of cash crops seems to contract from the 3rd century in correspondence with the reconversion of production. In the north, on the other hand, production seems to intensify probably due to the contraction of foreign imports and the demands of the court that had moved to Ravenna in the 5th century. The diversification in cultivation coincides with changing patterns in livestock farming. While the number of cattle, sheep and goats was on the rise in any region, there was a noticeable decrease of caprine in the north. In contrast, pig farming showed a decline in south-central Italy, potentially linked to demographic changes, while seeing a significant increase in the north. These contrasting trends in livestock farming across the peninsula suggest a move towards more localised farming and economic strategies, with extensive farming becoming more prevalent in the south and polyculture or intensive farming gaining prominence in the north and central regions.\n\n\n9.3.3 Early Middle Ages and the 11th century\nThe late Roman changes are accentuated in the early medieval period, especially from the 7th/8th century onwards, marking a significant turning point in crop choice and animal husbandry. Across Italy, the sites show an increased cultivation of cereals and legumes, irrespective of settlement type or location. Central and northern Italy, in particular, demonstrated a stronger reliance on more rustic cereals, a trend statistically supported by both a frequentist case study and Bayesian models. The decline of villas (especially in the north) and the emergence of fortified settlements as major storers of cereals and legumes highlight this shift. Free-threshing wheat and barley became more abundant cereals in archaeobotanical contexts, with a gradual decline in emmer. This cereal focus also explains the increase in cattle husbandry, which peaked in the 6th-7th centuries but decreased later in the 7th/8th centuries CE. The 7th and 8th centuries emerge as pivotal for studying agricultural economy, but the data available so far do not allow a more detailed study. In fact, the creation of models with a resolution of centuries would have produced credible intervals so wide that no convincing interpretation could be possible. The uncertainty in archaeological layer chronologies, mostly dated by ceramics, also contributes to this issue. Zooarchaeological studies can help to provide a more reliable date for the early medieval turning point, revealing evolving strategies in animal husbandry - cattle peaking in the 6th-7th centuries, sheep and goats increasing until the 7th-8th century and then decreasing, and a notable rise in pig numbers post the 7th century, especially in northern Italy.\nIn summary, the early medieval period is characterized by two main trends: the first spanning the 5th to 7th centuries, and the second occurring during the 8th and 9th centuries. The initial trend, which emerged already around the 3rd century, persisted until the late 6th and possibly into the 7th century. This trend is marked by an increasing localisation of agricultural activities. However, this shift does not signify a complete economic collapse. Rather, it suggests a strategic reorientation of the economy towards more self-sustained cereal cultivation and animal husbandry. This change could be viewed as a necessary economic reorganisation, particularly in response to the cessation of foreign grain imports during the late Roman period. The popularity of ‘minor’ cereals in the early Middle Ages, according to Montanari (1979), can be potentially also explained by their exemption from taxation4. The economy also becomes more pastoral, with sheep and goats grazing on fallow/uncultivated land. However, if transhumance was active, it was likely short-ranged, with an increase in sheep farming as a response to difficulties in moving large herds over long distances. This data suggests more continuity in the centre-south, while the north moved towards an economic and subsistence pattern reorganisation sooner.\nIn this framework, selections appeared to be following economic logic of cost and energy saving, which is also suggested by the development of urban gardens in cities. The shortage of workforce was further exacerbated by a demographic crisis. The population collapse cannot be related to changes in nutrition but was the result of multiple variables, particularly warfare and disease, the latter perhaps worsened by harsh winters (Barbiera and Dalla-Zuanna, 2009). The early medieval people were however able to adapt efficiently within these changes. Especially in the north, it is more evident how people were relying both on wild and domesticated resources for their diet (that was far from lacking variety), exploiting and taking advantage of their environment, and eventually domesticating forests with fruit trees (as chestnuts) where animals could graze.\nWhile it is accepted that Germanic populations, including the Lombards, placed a high ideological value on animal husbandry and probably influenced local practices after their migrations (e.g. an increased emphasis on meat consumption among the elite), we must be cautious in making direct associations between specific diets and social or ethnic groups. As Wickham (1985, pp. 411–2) points out (commenting on Duby, 2021), the focus should be on geographical logic rather than ethnicity. As Italy became more forested and control over the landscape less pervasive, people adapted by exploiting the forests in similar ways: pig farming proved to be a practical and versatile choice in this context.\nPrevious historical debate has only partially explained the complexities behind changes in crop selection during this period (cf. Chapter 2). One of the factors that may have played a role – according to these reconstructions – is the climatic instability of the 6th-7th century (Late Antique Little Ice Age). Fluctuating temperatures and increased rainfall may have affected farmers’ behaviour in relation to the crops they grow.\nTo fight climatic unpredictability, farmers could have used two methods: the selection of short-cycle crops with varied sowing and harvesting times, and utilising taxa that could be planted twice a year, such as millets.\nIn the event of a crop failure, these strategies mitigated the risks and allowed an alternative crop to be harvested in the summer. Millets, including proso and foxtail species, have been cultivated in Italy since the Bronze Age. Their rapid maturation (60-65 days after sowing) and potential for biennial cultivation, although sensitive to frost, make them a viable option in times of climatic uncertainty (Castiglioni and Rottoli, 2013; Renfrew, 1973, pp. 99–100). In addition, barley and rye, both of which tolerate cooler climates (but not extreme heat), were also potential options. Rye in particular is highly moisture tolerant and can grow faster than wheat at low temperatures (Leonard and Martin, 1963, p. 452; Renfrew, 1973, pp. 80–5). The increased prevalence of these ‘minor cereals’ has consequently been often associated with the climatic anomalies of the period. However, if we were to support this conclusion, our results suggest that this correlation might only be applicable to northern Italy. Despite also experiencing climatic instability (Sadori et al., 2016), southern Italy did not exhibit as much reliance on polyculture as the central-northern regions. The relationship between climate and crop selection is not entirely mechanistic. Therefore, we should avoid falling into the trap of environmental determinism when interpreting this. Furthermore, our models do not indicate any significant impact of changing climate on the cereals cultivated at lower altitudes. It appears that, across the peninsula, cereals respond similarly to altitude, and thus indirectly to temperature, in all phases of climate change. Although crop selection may have been influenced by climatic instability, a detailed understanding would require more extensive archaeobotanical data and precise climatic records. The obvious need is for greater temporal resolution, particularly in order to characterise the latter part of the early medieval phase with greater precision, a task that is not currently feasible. The 8th century poses a specific challenge due to the scarcity of available sites from this period5.\nAs more zooarchaeological data are generally available, the results of this study have been able to identify a final significant phase of change in animal husbandry during the first millennium, around the 9th/10th centuries, which extended into the 11th century. These findings indicate that the chronological divisions initially proposed in the methodology section (Chapter 6) may need revision in future studies. In this final chronological phase, several indicators point to economic growth. Firstly, the increase in pig populations in urban areas suggests a rising demand for meat, likely correlating with the demographic rise indicated by historical sources and paleodemographic studies (Barbiera and Dalla-Zuanna, 2009; Capasso and Malanima, 2012; Lo Cascio and Malanima, 2005). Secondly, the progressive growth in cattle numbers and the stabilisation of sheep and goat populations suggest that agriculture was reclaiming more spaces in this period.\nRegarding the impact of climatic variations on cereal cultivation, it is important to approach this with caution. While the onset of the ‘Medieval Warm Period’ (c. 900 - 1300 CE) brought temperatures in the northern Hemisphere back to levels similar to those of the ‘Roman Warm Period’ suggesting a potential boost to agriculture, we must be wary of overemphasizing climate as a deterministic factor. The warmer climate may have created more favourable conditions for crop growth, contributing to agricultural recovery, yet this interpretation requires careful consideration beyond simplistic environmental determinism. The improved climate and reorganisation of territories likely contributed to increased security in plant selection. This period also coincided with the advent of castle building, which asserted new forms of direct control in the surrounding territory. Fields and domesticated trees began to replace wild forests as humans increased their control over the landscape. Documentary and archaeological sources report land clearance in northern and central Italy beginning in the early 9th century (Buonincontri et al., 2020; Wickham, 1994, p. 195). During the Medieval Warm Period, free-threshing wheats are the most common and abundant cereals (perhaps mirroring a revival of the market system), followed by barley, rye, and proso millet. Interestingly, minor cereals were not completely abandoned. In tangent with the rise of temperatures, sorghum became more abundant in the 9th-11th century. This rise likely stems from this taxon’s ability to thrive in hot temperatures and tolerate drought.\n\n\n\n\nAccorsi, C.A., Bandini Mazzanti, Marta, Mercuri, A.M., Grandi G, T., P, F., S, P., 1999.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nThis dissertation explores the subsistence methods, economic systems and environmental adaptations of Italian peasant communities in the 1st millennium CE, with a particular focus on the transitional period from the Roman Empire to the early medieval era. Existing work on agricultural production in this period has been based on literary sources and field surveys, or has focused on individual sites or regional collections, while a multi-source archaeological study is absent from the discourse. This dissertation addresses this gap by using environmental proxies, reconstructing the historical agricultural landscape through the occurrence patterns of plants and animals in legacy data. To this end, 190 botanical and 466 faunal assemblages from 309 sites1 are quantitatively analysed within a Bayesian framework, using multilevel binomial and beta-binomial models to account for overdispersion and class imbalance in the datasets. The results reveal a strong trend towards regionalisation in agricultural strategies during the early medieval period. In addition, these findings expose variations in agricultural techniques and dietary patterns across Roman settlements, shedding light on the extent to which Roman agricultural and economic frameworks persisted or changed during the early medieval transition, and the adaptive agricultural strategies adopted by farmers. The quantitative analytical findings of this dissertation are also contextualised alongside wider historical sources, archaeological evidence, and current debate, allowing for a bottom-up understanding of the agricultural regimes in question. This work represents the first attempt to use temporally and geographically diverse bioarchaeological data to visualise the Italian agricultural landscape across the longue durée. By systematising the data in an open database, this dissertation also represents an effort at quantitative knowledge sharing in archaeology. Overall, these novel perspectives on human-nature interaction allow scholars to methodologically, theoretically and empirically evaluate agricultural strategies during the transition from the Roman Empire to the politically fragmented landscape of the early medieval Italian peninsula."

    "text": "4.5 Notes on nomenclature\nThe names of the faunal species used in this study adhere to the conventional Linnean nomenclature provided in Gentry et al. (2004). To ensure comparability, the dataset encompasses most of the common species encountered in excavations. Specific models have been developed for the primary domesticated species - Sus scrofa (pigs), Bos taurus (cattle), Ovis aries (sheep), and Capra hircus (goats). Sheep and goats are difficult to distinguish unless specific bones (or the whole skeleton) are found in archaeological excavations, and are therefore modelled together (Halstead et al., 2002; Prummel and Frisch, 1986; Zeder and Lapham, 2010). In the analyses, these animals are collectively referred to taxonomically as caprine, aligning with the nomenclature used in other studies (Albarella, 2019; MacKinnon, 2002; Salvadori, 2019; Trentacoste et al., 2023; Trentacoste et al., 2018).\nFor statistical analyses of rarer species, these have been grouped as follows:\n\nDomestic fowl: Gallus gallus (chicken), Anser anser (goose).\nWild game animals: Sus scrofa ferus (wild boar), Cervus elaphus (red deer), Dama dama (fallow deer), Capreolus capreolus (roe deer), other Cervidae, Lepus sp. (lagomorphs), Glis glis (dormouse), and various wild birds.\n\nOther species included in the database but not modeled due to their rarity, inedibility, lack of economic significance, or uncertain identification include Canis familiaris (dog), Equus asinus (donkey), Equus caballus (horse), Ursus arctos (bear), Vulpes vulpes (fox), and others. As previously discussed, fish and birds are notably underrepresented in excavation reports. Molluscs, often not recorded or not differentiated between terrestrial and marine species in older excavations, are more specifically identified in recent excavations. These instances have typically been documented in the extra_notes column with their total count in the mollusca column.\n\n\n\n\nAlbarella, U., 2019.
