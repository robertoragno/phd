    "text": "Dipartimento di Ricerca e Innovazione Umanistica, Università di Bari Aldo Moro, Bari, Italy\n\nEMAIL\n\nroberto.ragno@uniba.it\n\n\nOverview\nThis research aims to diachronically trace the patterns of subsistence, economy, and environmental change in relation to regional patterns of Italian peasantry in the 1st millennium CE. Scholarly debate on the dynamics of human-nature interaction in Italy during the transition from Late Antiquity to the early Middle Ages still leaves today some open questions. Were the former Roman economic structures and farming practices completely abandoned or did they find continuity during this turbulent time? Which agricultural strategies did peasants develop to cope with political, demographic and climatic change? Past work on agricultural production has been based upon literary sources and field surveys which identify boundaries; a multi-source archaeological study is absent from the discourse. Drawing on environmental proxies, such as animal, seed, and pollen remains, this project uses data from >261 sites 1 (172 botanical and 379 faunal samples2) and statistical/dimensionality reduction methods (CA, NCA, nMDS). Specific emphasis is placed on evaluating agricultural strategies during the shift from the Roman Empire to the politically fragmented landscape of early medieval Italy, to assess the role of political organization, economy, culture, and environment in the configuration of agricultural regimes and animal/plant husbandry selection. The integration of different sources is fundamental to casting new light on peasants’ lifeways, which may be obscured in the textual records, privileging elite contexts and high-status transactions. The Early Middle Ages mark a period of fundamental change when different geographical regions (and potentially micro-regions) developed their own political and economic frameworks for agricultural production. Bioarchaeological evidence can help visualise the landscape in which these changes were taking place, as archive collections of samples are subjected to new analyses in a holistic context, through the database I have constructed. For example, one can analyse differences in diet and production between elite, religious, urban and rural sites, and conduct regional pattern analysis. Preliminary results show indeed higher degrees of regionalization in agricultural strategies during the EMA. My dissertation will contextualize these findings against textual sources to assess how people used the Italian agricultural landscape, and suggest which agents were responsible for changes. I argue that the discourse on Northern Italian/French early Medieval production has heavily influenced interpretations of the agrarian economies of the rest of the peninsula.\n\n\nCase studies\nThe map below shows the distribution of the samples used for this project.

    "text": "4.3 Archaeobotany\nIntroduce the topic and methodological issues\nBIASES: Talk about the biases and dataset problems here or do it in the Materials chapter?\n\n4.3.1 Ubiquity\nUbiquity, or presence analysis, is a popular approach in archaeobotanical quantitative analysis. The method is straightforward-the number of sites/contexts where a plant is present is divided by the total number of sites/contexts under examination. If, for instance, an olive pit is present in 3 sites out of 10, the ubiquity for the olive will be 30%. The formula for the calculation is at follows:\n\\[\nU_x = (\\frac{N_p}{N_{tot}}) \\cdot 100\n\\] where \\(N_p\\) is the number of presences, and \\(N_{tot}\\) is the total number of contexts. The result can be multiplied by 100 to obtain a score in %.\nThis approach has both advantages and drawbacks. Presence analysis minimizes the impact of outliers (overrepresented plant species) on calculations (Wright (2010), 51-52), but the relative importance of a plant in a particular context is lost. It is also important to keep in mind that taxa richness is influenced by factors including sample size, deposition and preservation modes, and sampling strategies (e.g. sieving methodologies) (Pearsall (2015), 161-2).\n\nWrite about sample size problems and include a graph\nWrite about deposition and preservation\nWrite about sampling strategies\nWrite about the problems of this dataset that led to the choice of ubiquity as parameter\n\nUbiquity is the best option to immediately read the Italian peninsular botanical dataset. The variability in the seeds/fruits samples is too high, with different species being outliers in different sites. A likely reason for this is probably the poor sampling quality, usually occurring after an agglomerate of seeds is found during excavation. Normally, agglomerates are found in specific storage places or processing areas (e.g. wine/olive processing quarters), skewing the distribution of the curve. Ubiquity overcomes this issue, as it provides a score based on the percentage of presences of a plant species in the samples considered.\nIn addition to the general calculation of the diachronic ubiquity in the entire peninsula, it is also important to look for regional differences in the archaeobotanical dataset. To do so, I created an R function to subset data related to Northern, Central and Southern Italian regions. For a clearer reading of the plot, I divided the plants into–Cereals, Pulses and Fruits/Nuts. The results are in Chapter 5."

There are mainly two types of databases—relational and non-relational. A relational database is more appropriate for well-defined data structures which can be linked through a mutual attribute. It is built and maintained with Structured Query Language (SQL), which allows the user to interrogate the database through queries (Gattiglia (2018)). A SQL database consists of several tables containing information in columns (variables) and rows (entries). Each row is defined by an unique key. Examples of relational database management systems include—MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle Database. A non-relational database (NoSQL) is advantageous in the case of unstructured data, as data is archived as a single document rather than in a table. This structure allows much more flexibility, although NoSQL databases can be harder to use by non-specialists. Among the NoSQL database management systems, MongoDB is the most widely used.\nMost of the archaeological databases are based on SQL, as the visual relationships between different data structures are easier to understand. This project uses a relational database based on MariaDB, a fast and stable fork of MySQL. The creation of a database for this research responded to the need of a systematic approach in storing environmental data in a common format and in a way that is convenient for querying, rather than merely archiving the information. The goal is to have data readily available for exploratory data analysis, in an automated process that does not require to adapt the query and manually wrangle data each time a new sample is added to the collection. The data was stored in the database after a thorough bibliographical research of the excavated sites (with a chronology pertaining to the 1st millennium CE) where environmental analyses were undertaken. As in most of the cases the material was retrieved from physical publications, not digitised, the process of data entry was manual and could not be automatised.\nMaybe insert a small graph of the bibliography to see where most of the materials came from (Books, journals etc)"
