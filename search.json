The region was shaped by various invasions, conflicts, and demographic shifts. Northern Italy garnered new political relevance around the time of Germanic migrations from the Alps, and the capture of the western Roman Empire in 476 CE. Ravenna, situated on the coast of modern Emilia-Romagna, became a crucial center of power as Odoacer deposed the last Roman emperor and began his rule of Italy. Subsequently, Theodoric led the Ostrogoths in an invasion of Italy, responding to the Byzantine emperor Zeno’s orders. The Ostrogoths established their dominance, ruling until 554 CE. However, the Gothic Wars (535–554 CE), waged between the Eastern Roman Empire and the Ostrogoth kingdom for two decades, caused great instabilities in the peninsula. Cities were destroyed, infrastructure was ruined, and the population suffered significant losses. In 568–569 CE, the Lombards initiated their conquest of Italy, adding another layer of complexity to the political landscape. Although unable to conquer the entire peninsula, the Lombards faced resistance from the Byzantine Empire in the south and encountered various independent duchies in the north. Several Lombard dukes vied for territorial power, contributing to a disorganized and chaotic campaign. The Lombard kingdom was roughly divided into two regions: Longobardia Maior (Greater Lombardy) in the north and Longobardia Minor (Lesser Lombardy) in central-southern Italy. Pavia, located in Longobardia Maior within the Lombardy region, served as the capital and a significant political and cultural center for the Lombards in the north. They had control over territories such as Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna and parts of Veneto and Piedmont. In Longobardia Minor, the capital was established in the city of Benevento, located in the Campania region of today’s southern Italy. Benevento served as the political and administrative center for the Lombards in central-southern Italy. They controlled parts of modern-day Campania, Apulia, Calabria, Basilicata, and Molise. In addition, the Lombards held the Duchy of Spoleto, based in the city of Spoleto in central Italy. Spoleto was an important Lombard duchy that included parts of Umbria, Latium and Marche. However, the Lombard kingdom faced challenges and conflicts with the Byzantine Empire in the south and encountered rivalries within their own kingdom. These internal divisions and power struggles contributed to a fragmented political landscape, with different regions under the control of various rulers. The political dynamics in the Lombard kingdom continued to evolve, influenced by external powers such as the Franks. Under Charlemagne, the Franks conquered the north of Italy in 774 CE (Wickham, 2005, pp. 33–35). The subsequent division of the Carolingian Empire and the emergence of feudal states further contributed to the political complexities of Northern and Southern Italy. After the Frankish conquest, the borders of Northern Italy moved several times, reconfiguring along political lines. When Louis the Pious (Charlemagne’s son) divided the kingdom into three parts in his Treaty of Verdun (843 CE), Lothar I was proclaimed “king of the Lombards” in Italy (Collins, 2010, p. 306). The further division of the Carolingian empire in 887 CE caused anarchy and the emergence of feudal states in Northern Italy (Sergi, 2000). Further instability throughout the 9th century was caused by the arrival of Muslim raiders from North Africa known as the Saracens. The Saracen invasions caused widespread devastation along the Italian coasts, especially in the South, disrupting trade and commerce and threatening the security of the region. These rapid and almost frantic political changes in Italy were also accompanied by a decline in the regional demography. The overall Italian population decreased from 10 million in the 5th century to 8 million in the 6th century (Lo Cascio and Malanima, 2005). The demography remained constant until the 10th century, but then it gradually increased. Among the causes of this phenomenon, diseases played a major role because illness was exacerbated by non-favourable climatic conditions (Barbiera and Dalla-Zuanna, 2009). Two climatic anomalies affected the temperatures of the Northern Hemisphere in the Early Middle Ages. These two events are known as the Late Antique Little Ice Age (536-660 CE ca.) and the Medieval Warm Period (900-1300 CE ca.).\n\n2.2.1 Demography\nSources:\nRoman\nHanson (2016)"

    "section": "2.3 The Agricultural Economy",
    "text": "2.3 The Agricultural Economy\nThis research places significant emphasis on the role of agricultural economy. In pre-modern societies, agriculture held a central position as it not only provided sustenance but also served as a primary source of taxation. The transition from early forms of hunter-gatherer economies to more controlled and centralized systems has been a subject of extensive debate among scholars. One compelling perspective on this transition is presented by James Scott (2017), who introduced the concept of “grain states”. These were systems that relied on regular harvests and the ability to store and tax grain, which served as a predictable and taxable form of income. Grains, in particular common bread wheat and barley, exemplify these characteristics. They can be sown in the winter (although not necessarily) and harvested in early summer, requiring comparatively less intensive field management during their growth period. On the other hand, crops like legumes and fruits demand more intensive care, and the storage of fruits, for instance, poses challenges and is not suitable for long-distance transportation. Ancient Rome is an example of such “grain state”, as the empire heavily relied on cereals both for taxation purposes and to sustain its own population, especially during its peak demographic period. The ability to predictably tax and manage the production of grains played a crucial role in sustaining the empire’s vast territory, and agriculture, being the main sector of the economy at this time (Heinrich, 2017), held significant importance. The imperial period has been extensively studied and debated in relation to ancient Roman agricultural economy. In the following section, various economic models of the Roman agricultural system will be introduced. Traditionally, much of the focus has been on villa productions, with less attention given to smallholders. More recently, there has been an increase in interest in Roman peasants, and archaeological research has played a crucial role in shedding light on their lives, which are often overshadowed by documentary sources. Identifying Roman peasantry through archaeology is nevertheless not a straightforward task, as the traces are often less conspicuous compared to the monumental structures associated with elites or the well-preserved artifacts found in urban contexts. In this research, I will explore the use of archaeobotanical and zooarchaeological data to trace peasant strategies and trace their agricultural practices. While the factors influencing crop selection have been more explicitly discussed for the Republican and early imperial periods, the same level of insight is not as readily available for other periods within the scope of this research, particularly in Italy. However, there has been significant discussion among historians regarding changes in agricultural practices during the early medieval period, which will be examined. Overall, past archaeological literature has contributed to our understanding of rural dynamics, but the integration with different types of archaeological sources can improve this picture.\n\n2.3.1 The Roman imperial phase\nWhen examining agriculture in the late Roman Republic and Empire, there is a prevalent image of a dominus overseeing a vast estate, known as a villa, with enslaved individuals working in the fields. This image, influenced by classical texts such as Cato’s De agri cultura and Columella’s De re rustica, has led to the association of Roman agriculture with a quasi-capitalist framework. While scholars like Max Weber (2008) have acknowledged capitalist elements in the Roman economy, such as its inclination towards a market system, they have not fully recognized capitalism in Roman agriculture (Love, 1986). The absence of a labour market and the prevalence of slavery pose challenges to the direct application of a capitalist framework in understanding Roman agricultural practices. Moses Finley (1973) adopted a “primitivist” approach, aligning with some of Weber’s perspectives. Finley argued that Roman agriculture primarily operated under a pre-capitalist mode of production. According to Finley, the Roman agricultural system relied heavily on personal relationships, social status, patronage, and traditional forms of labour organization, rather than conforming to capitalist market dynamics. He contended that the Roman elite lacked the entrepreneurial mindset necessary for economic and technological growth (Haas and Tol, 2017, p. 16). This position was much criticised by the “modernists”, notably Peter Temin (2013, p. 114), who instead believed that ancient Rome had a labour market and questioned the notion that slavery indicated a non-market economy, especially considering the unique characteristics of ancient slavery in comparison to its modern counterpart. Temin (2013, p. 4) famously argued that “the economy of the early Roman Empire was primarily a market economy”. Modernist approaches conceptualise classical economy in a similar fashion to the modern one, with mechanisms of supply and demand. The existence of a market system is evident in the transportation of agricultural products across the peninsula and the broader Roman Empire. The movement of such goods indicates the presence of economic exchanges and trade networks. Furthermore, specific agricultural products became associated with particular regions or places, highlighting the localization of production. For instance, in the Roman suburbium, one could find pears from Signia, nuts from Praeneste, and pastio villatica (the production of luxury items such as small birds, honey, flowers for banquets, etc.) from Tarquinii (Marzano, 2008; Morley, 1996a, pp. 88–89).\n\n\n\nProduction in the Roman suburbium. Image after Morley (1996a, p. 84).\n\n\nSeveral adjustments to both models have been put forth more recently, with some scholars arguing that the primitivist/modernist dichotomy is too extreme and that more recent economical frameworks need to be considered, specifically New Institutional Economics (NIE) and Complexity Economics (CE) (Van Limbergen et al., 2022, p. 2). The first, NIE, considers the role of institutions and organizations in driving the economic behaviour of societies. In this approach, economic growth is only obtained through a market system (Scheidel et al., 2007). The lack of agency in NIE has been criticised by Wilson and Flohr (2016, p. 4), who believe that institutions are just starting points for economic strategies. In turn, CE is more dynamic, allowing agents to create and adapt strategies according to specific situations: economic systems are in fact “complex adaptive systems” (Van Limbergen et al., 2022, p. 6; Verboven, 2021). As noted by Kim Bowes (2021), alongside the on-going academic debate on which economic framework is best suited for Roman economy, the study of the ancient economy experienced a significant shift in the 1990s with some historians embracing a cliometric turn. Scholars increasingly employed quantitative methods and sought to quantify various aspects of the Roman economy, including the measurement of gross domestic product (GDP), economic performance, inequality, and other key indicators. Some of these methods are collected in the work “Quantifying the Roman Economy: Methods and Problems” (Bowman and Wilson, 2009). While the integration of quantitative approaches in ancient economics is on the rise, it is important to acknowledge that these methods are not without their limitations. In this respect, Bowes (2021, pp. 8–10) raises critical points regarding certain efforts in the field. Specifically, she directs her criticism towards works that draw comparisons between the ancient economy and other premodern economies, such as 17th century England or 10th century China, using methods that have received little scrutiny. Bowes argues that instead of relying solely on such comparisons, it is more valuable to focus on obtaining granular data at the household level. While Bowes’ critique highlights the need for caution and a more nuanced approach in employing quantitative methods, it does not diminish the overall trend of increasing integration of these approaches in the study of ancient economies. Recent publications exemplify this integration by showcasing the use of quantitative methods in studying the Roman economy. For instance, the volume “Complexity Economics: Building a New Approach to Ancient Economic History” (Verboven, 2021) features case studies that employ network analysis and computational modelling to understand the complexities of the Roman economy. Similarly, the book “Simulating Roman Economies: Theories, Methods, and Computational Models” (Brughmans and Wilson, 2022) delves into the application of computational models to simulate and analyse Roman economic systems. These examples demonstrate the growing integration of quantitative approaches in the study of ancient economies, allowing researchers to explore the empirical dimensions of the Roman economy while also engaging with theoretical discussions. Despite their increasing integration into the economic debate, it is indeed true, as Bowes (2021, p. 27) pointed out, that these new major textbooks often prioritize large-scale questions and run the risk of creating deterministic narratives that view the past through teleological lenses of “rise” and “fall.” This limitation is perhaps inherent in computational modelling, which tends to focus on hypothesis testing and requires substantial data to construct narratives and contextualize the information historically. The need to make the reasoning behind causal inference more explicit when constructing models will be addressed in the subsequent discussion (§SIGNPOST HERE).\nIf the section began with an image depicting large estates worked by slaves in the Roman rural countryside (which we will revisit shortly), they were not the sole labour force involved. The post-war historical debate has placed increasing emphasis on the presence of other agents in the Roman rural landscape. In this context, the work of Karl Marx had for sure an impact in the popularity of bottom-up histories, as Eric Hobsbawm (1998, pp. 178–185) remarks. While slaves undoubtedly played a significant role especially in large-scale farming operations, agricultural activities encompassed a diverse range of individuals and groups. After all, traditional Roman texts consistently portray the image of a simple peasant working on a fundus to sustain his family. Free peasants involved in agricultural activities could take on different roles as either freeholders or tenants (coloni). Peter Garnsey, one of the historians who extensively studied peasants in the Classical age, mentions tenancy as “the most common method of production in the empire taken as a whole” (Garnsey, 1998, p. 94). In fact, peasants were not limited to working on small-scale agricultural plots. They could also be involved in renting and cultivating both large and small estates. In his writings, the Roman agronomist Columella (2010, pp. 81–84) expresses criticism towards farmers who rent extensive parcels of land and neglect their responsibilities by leaving their servants in charge. He also disapproves of farmers who choose to reside in the town rather than overseeing their lands directly. Roman tenancy agreements, which are primarily known through the preserved Egyptian contracts, displayed a remarkable degree of diversity. These agreements encompassed various structures, ranging from short-term to long-term leases, and the methods of rent payment varied as well. If monetary payment was customary, sharecropping could be an alternative option for tenants. Sharecropping involved a fixed payment in kind, which provided tenants with some protection against market fluctuations. Sharecropping can be understood as an arrangement where tenants contribute a portion of their agricultural produce to the landlord instead of paying rent in cash. This practice mitigated the risks associated with market volatility, as the tenant and landlord shared the uncertainties of agricultural production together (Erdkamp, 2005, pp. 26–29). In a letter from 107 CE in Pliny the Younger’s Epistulae (1962, p. 301), it is clear how sharecropping increased risk not only for the tenant but also for the landlord, but it also encouraged long-term profitability. The sharing of risks and rewards created a mutually beneficial relationship between the tenant and the landlord. Sharecropping was particularly well-suited for capital-intensive arable farming, as suggested by Pieter W. de Neeve (1990). This includes the cultivation of cash crops like olives and grapes, which necessitated substantial investments. In addition to slaves and tenants, there were other types of labourers in the Roman rural countryside, which are rarely discussed in ancient sources. These included wage-earners, known as mercenarii, and debt-bondsmen, known as obaerarii. Varro (1934, p. 225), in his De re rustica, is informative on this matter:\n\nAll agriculture is carried on by men — slaves, or freemen, or both; by freemen, when they till the ground themselves, as many poor people do with the help of their families; or hired hands (mercenarii), when the heavier farm operations, such as the vintage and the haying, are carried on by the hiring of freemen; and those whom our people called obaerarii and of whom there are still many in Asia, in Egypt, and in Illyricum. With regard to these in general this is my opinion: it is more profitable to work unwholesome lands with hired hands than with slaves; and even in wholesome places it is more profitable thus to carry out the heavier farm operations, such as storing the products of the vintage or harvest.\n\nAmong these workers, the role of wage labourers is of particular interest. According to scholars like Peter Garnsey (1998), the significance of slavery in rural production may have been overstated. Both Paul Erdkamp (2005, pp. 80–83) and Garnsey (1998, p. 108) suggest that wage labourers were primarily found on large estates, where they would supplement the work of slaves during peak agricultural periods such as grain harvest and vintage. Wage labourers might not have constituted a distinct social class. Instead, they could also have been individuals who owned or rented their own farms and engaged in wage labour to earn additional income (Garnsey, 1998, p. 145). K. D. White (1970) estimates that dedicating 100 out of the 250 working days available to cultivating the land is adequate for subsistence farming. As a result, subsistence farmers would have approximately three months of available time for engaging in paid work. If small-scale farmers were not primarily focused on surplus production, they had the potential to offer additional labour. However, it is the large estates or villas that emerge as the most significant surplus producers for the market. The villae rusticae, which are believed to have originated in Thyrrenian Central Italy, specifically in regions such as Latium, northern Campania, and southern Tuscany (Etruria), are described in particular by Varro and Columella (Marzano, 2007). Villas were characterized by their dual composition—a residential section (pars urbana) and a productive centre (pars rustica). The residential section was reserved for the landowner, while the latter served as the productive core of the villa, where slaves were dedicated to cultivating cash crops. Among these, grapes and olives held particular significance, as wine and olive oil could be transported over long distances. By the mid-1st c. CE, it is estimated that there were seventy-one grape cultivars (varieties) and fifteen olive varieties in cultivation (Marzano, 2022, p. 276). These crops were not only labour-intensive, requiring a significant workforce especially during peak seasons, but also demanded substantial initial investments. To support the production of wine and olive oil, cellar rooms (cellae vinariae or oleariae) needed to be constructed to store the produce in buried containers known as dolia defossa. Further high costs resulted from other necessary facilities, including presses, floors, vats (palmenti) and additional related structures and equipment. Additionally, the harvest also needed to be protected from pests, such as caterpillars, mice, and foxes (Dodd, 2022; Hollander, 2019, pp. 27–28). To appreciate the significance of such expenditure, one must take into account that the profitability of these investments frequently took several years to manifest: grapevines and olive trees typically reached their full productive capacity only after a decade of cultivation. Extensive research has been conducted on villas, resulting in a vast bibliography on the subject. What we can assert is that villas began to appear in the 2nd-1st century BCE as large estates that specialized in cultivating specific cash crops, particularly olives and grapes for the production of olive oil and wine. The owners of these villas rarely engaged directly in agricultural work. Instead, they entrusted the daily management of the estate to a vilicus who oversaw the day-to-day affairs of the villa (Marcone, 2004). The subject of “slave villas” (villa schiavistica) has occupied much of the ongoing debate surrounding Roman agrarian history, and it continues to generate significant interest. Notably, the first scientific Italian excavation of a Roman site was the excavation of a villa in Southern Tuscany known as Settefinestre. Andrea Carandini (1985), working within a Marxist framework, portrayed the villa as a plantation reminiscent of American colonial style, highlighting the significant role of slavery in the operation of these estates. The increased number of slaves following the Punic Wars (fought between 264 and 146 BCE) was a decisive factor in the expansion of villas, as it provided villa owners with a substantial labour force to work the lands. This was particularly significant considering the post-war decline in the population, which resulted in a decreased availability of citizens to engage in agricultural work due to their involvement in wars (Toynbee, 1965). Furthermore, the eastward expansion during the late Republic and early Empire had a notable impact on the availability of slaves for agricultural labour. Carandini (1981) suggested that these centuries mark a shift from Republican small-scale family-sized farms to profit-oriented large-estates. While it remains true that villas mainly employed a large amount of slaves in their production, a variety of free workers could have also been employed, especially when more workforce was required. When eventually Roman expansionism slowed down in the 2nd c. CE, the resulting crisis in the availability of slaves pushed landowners towards other forms of management (Pinchetti, 2021, p. 10). In this period, the number of tenancy contracts increased significantly, with coloni leasing rural plots for short or long-term occupancy solutions, already discussed above.\nIn the previous paragraph, we discussed the development of villae rusticae and their exploitation of cash crops. Cash crops, particularly grapes and olives, were highly indicated for their market value and long-distance transportability. The selection of crops on any given farm was influenced by various factors, including economic considerations. Understanding why crop selection is important economically involves analysing choices such as selecting cereals over arboriculture and the specific type of cereal to cultivate. Multiple cereals can be chosen, or only one, each with different nutritional values, yields, and adaptability to different climates and geographies. Factors such as climate, soil quality, water availability, and geographic location must also be considered for the choice of cereal crops. Furthermore, crops have varying shelf lives, which affect their storage and marketability. When deciding which crops to cultivate, farmers take into account market demand, production costs, storage capabilities, and processing requirements. They assess the profitability of different crops based on factors like yield, market price, and input costs. For instance, farmers may choose between cash crops that yield immediate income, like grapes and olives mentioned earlier, which require significant investments but offer potential long-term returns. On the other hand, cereals serve as staple food crops but may have lower market value and profit margins. Within the cereal category, farmers must consider specific grain types. Some crops, like naked wheats, are less durable and more susceptible to damage from bacteria, fungi, and other pests during storage. Conversely, hulled wheats provide better protection but require additional processing, which adds to the production costs. Numerous crop selection models have been proposed for the Roman age, and a comprehensive overview is provided in Heinrich (2017). One of the earliest scholars to discuss crop selection in the Roman era, albeit in different terms, was the economist Naum Jasny. Jasny’s research on competition among grains in classical antiquity (1944; 1942) compared different cereal taxa based on productivity, performance, geological adaptability, and economic factors. Notably, Jasny argued for a transition from emmer wheat (Triticum dicoccum) to hard wheat (Triticum durum) during the Roman age, which was completed in Late Antiquity. According to Jasny, hard wheat provided better yields and was more suitable for bread baking. Emilio Sereni, a historian and author of Storia del paesaggio agrario Italiano (1961), provided a model specifically for Italy. Sereni also observed the shift towards hard wheat, but his approach was less evolutionistic compared to Jasny. Sereni argued that hulled wheats were inferior to naked wheats, while Jasny believed that the choice between naked and hulled wheats depended on specific circumstances. In his work, Sereni emphasized the strong correlation between crop selection and economic factors—during periods of economic growth, specialization occurred, whereas periods of depression led to greater crop diversity. In line with this perspective, Sereni argued that the number of cereal crops was higher in Republican Rome compared to the Imperial period, only to experience growth once again in Late Antiquity. This perspective contradicted Jasny’s evolutionary viewpoint. In the 1980s, another significant contribution to crop selection models is found in the works of M.S. Spurr (1986, 1983). Spurr responded to the perspectives put forth by Jasny and Sereni by arguing against the significance of climatic and geological factors in crop selection, emphasizing the overriding importance of economic considerations for peasants. According to Spurr’s model, specialization would be the logical outcome of a thriving agricultural economy. However, this was not the case in Roman agriculture which was characterized by high diversification and by the use of ‘minor’ crops including millets. Robert Sallares (1991) also identified a transition from hulled to naked wheats in classical Greece, and argued that it was an unintentional process of crop improvement that originated in Neolithic times. Sallares challenged Jasny’s perspective by suggesting that factors beyond cereal suitability criteria, such as demographic pressure, played a more significant role in the crop selection process. Furthermore, recent research conducted by Daphne Lentjes (2013), focusing on several sites in southeast Italy occupied during the 1st millennium BCE, revealed that while naked wheats became slightly more prevalent, other cereal taxa remained present without notable disappearance. Frits Heinrich’s perspective on crop selection in the Roman era takes a more cautious approach, emphasizing the importance of precise archaeobotanical quantifications that go beyond simple presence/absence analyses. Heinrich highlights that crop selection was highly situational and influenced by factors such as market accessibility and taxation exemptions, particularly in the case of Roman Italy. The absence of taxation for Italian farmers provided them with greater freedom in choosing which crops to cultivate (Heinrich, 2017).\nThe scope of agricultural decision-making was not only limited to plants, but included also animals. The historian Geoffrey Kron (2004), mostly basing on textual and zooarchaeological evidence, argued that convertible husbandry was a common practice in Roman times. Further hypotheses for this practice, based on archaeological evidence, can be found in The Roman Peasant Project (Bowes, 2020), a series of excavations conducted between 2009 and 2014 in Southern Tuscany that specifically targeted peasant settlements. Convertible husbandry, also known as ley farming, involved a strategic allocation of arable land for both crop cultivation and pasture. Kron maintains that by implementing ley agriculture, peasants could optimize the productivity of their farms. The process of ley farming followed a productive regenerating cycle. Initially, certain plots of the farm are intensively cultivated with crops, such as cereals. Subsequently, these plots were sown with legumes, which served as nitrogen-fixing plants (Liu et al., 2011). Although ancient agronomists may not have fully understood the scientific basis behind this practice, they were aware of the positive effects of legumes on soil fertility, as writings by Cato and Columella suggest (Hollander, 2019, p. 30). Support for the benefits of legumes can also be found in the works of Theophrastus (1980, p. 199), a Greek botanist who noted in his Historia Plantarum (written around the fourth to third century BCE) that beans seemed to have a fertilizing effect:\n\nBeans, as was said, are in other ways not a burdensome crop to the ground, they even seem to manure it, because the plant is of loose growth and rots easily.\n\nFollowing the cultivation of legumes, the cultivated plots were set aside and utilized as pastures, known as leys, for a specific period of time. This rotational approach ensured that there was always a designated area available for livestock grazing. By allowing the land to rest and serve as pasture, farmers not only provided a source of food for their animals but also allowed for the regeneration of the soil. When selecting livestock, farmers took into account various factors, including economic considerations, resource availability, and market demand. They assessed the potential profitability and suitability of different livestock species based on their ability to yield meat, dairy, and other secondary products (e.g. wool, fat, etc.). While climatic conditions had a relatively smaller impact on animal selection compared to crop selection, it is true that certain environments are more conducive to raising specific species. For example, pigs were a versatile choice that could be raised almost anywhere. However, raising them in forested areas was economically advantageous due to the availability of acorns and other nuts, which served as a natural and abundant food source for pigs (Hollander, 2019, p. 34). This utilization of local resources optimized the efficiency of livestock production and minimized the need for external inputs. The selection of animals for specific purposes, such as draught animals for agricultural work or specialized breeds for specific products like wool or milk, further exemplified the complexity of the selection process. In Roman times, cattle were the most common working animals, primarily utilized for traction in agricultural operations. Their main role was to provide the power necessary for plowing, pulling carts, and other tasks requiring heavy labour. However, cattle also served other purposes, including meat production, leather, and the utilization of their bones for various crafts and tools. The cattle husbandry sector experienced growth and specialization during this period, as evidenced by the significant increase in the average height of cattle during the Imperial age. Research conducted by De Grossi Mazzorin and Minniti (2022, pp. 70–71) provides insights into the changing characteristics of cattle in Rome. The study examined the average height at the withers, a key measurement in determining the size of quadrupeds. In the Republican phase, the average height was reported as 115.7 (N=9, SD=11.9), while during the Imperial phase, it increased to 129.4 (N=18, SD=6.2). This increase in height indicates a deliberate focus on breeding larger and stronger cattle, reflecting the demand for more efficient and powerful working animals. Certain regions of the peninsula specialized in cattle breeding. Areas such as Venosa, Sabina (north of Rome), southern Etruria, the Alps, and pre-Alps were known for their specialized cattle husbandry practices (De Grossi Mazzorin and Minniti, 2022, p. 68). While larger estates had the means to sustain multiple working animals, small-scale peasants likely had to manage with just one. Alternatively, they might have resorted to renting or borrowing animals from neighbouring farmers on an as-needed basis. Farmers had to weigh the benefits and costs of different animal types to ensure optimal utilization of resources and maximize their economic returns. The interaction between crop selection and animal farming was intricately connected, as the availability and suitability of certain crops influenced the choice of livestock and vice versa. For example, the cultivation of specific crops like fodder or forage crops played a crucial role in providing feed for livestock and, as argued above, the by-products of animal farming, such as manure, were valuable resources for crop cultivation, contributing to the overall agricultural productivity. In addition to these considerations, various factors influenced the choice of animals to raise, similar to the selection process for plants. For example, pig meat was highly valued and likely in high demand during periods of population density. The Roman suburbium, with its proximity to the city of Rome, likely played a significant role in pig farming, as evidenced by numerous excavations reporting pigs as the most prevalent faunal remains. Specifically, the presence of certain cuts of pig meat suggests patterns of consumption (De Grossi Mazzorin and Minniti, 2022).\n\n\n2.3.2 Late Roman Phase\nTracing the agrarian history of the late Roman period is a challenging task, primarily due to the inner limitations of ancient sources that predominantly inform us on the lives of the elite. The representation of the medium and small class of peasants in these sources is limited, hindering a comprehensive understanding of their experiences. Much of the available evidence often pertains to fiscal matters, leading historians to concentrate on topics such as slavery, wage labor, tenancy contracts, and the fate of what used to be the core of Roman large-scale agricultural production: the rural villa. Several studies have focused on explaining the transformations that took place in villas during the period from the 3rd to the 5th century. Beth Munro (2012) identified three distinct phases in this phenomenon. The first phase, observed in the 3rd century, reveals an overall decline in the number of villas. In the subsequent phase, occurring in the 4th century, the surviving villas underwent a process of monumentalisation. This involved the enhancement and embellishment of existing structures, perhaps as a response to socio-political changes or the desire for ostentatious displays of wealth and status. The final phase, extending into the 5th and 6th centuries, witnessed a gradual abandonment of villas. This phase is characterized by a progressive disintegration of the once thriving villa culture, as various factors – which will be examined shortly – potentially contributed to the declining significance of villas during this period.\nThe focus on villas in the study of late empire agrarian history is primarily attributed to their prominent role as cash crop producers during the late Republic and early imperial phase, as described in the previous section. The significant contribution of villas to agricultural production during this period has led many scholars to speculate that the decline in the number of villas was linked to a decline in overall agricultural output. Support for this hypothesis can be found in ceramic findings, which indicate an increase in the prevalence of foreign imports. While wine exports may have experienced a decline in the late 1st and early 2nd centuries, the production of wine, a commodity closely associated with rural villas, continued to hold significance in Italy. However, there was a noticeable shift towards more localized wine production, as documented by Clementina Panella (1989) and André Tchernia (1986). The question of whether a crisis occurred during the late empire period is a subject of debate among scholars. Prominent archaeologists such as Carandini (1989, p. 130) argue for the occurrence of a crisis and destructuration during the Antonine age:\n\nThe end of the second century brought to an end for Italy the chapter that had opened with the end of the Second Punic War and that had made the peninsula for the first time the economic centre of the world to the west of Mesopotamia. Some believe that this sad fate is limited to coastal Etruria. Let us leave this illusion to those who have no direct experience of the archaeological and agricultural landscapes of the other regions of central and southern Italy. It is possible that late antiquity, too, had its rationalities, beauties and riches in Italy, but as yet no one can tell us exactly where. So far are only clear the signs of the ruin and decay of the extraordinary pomarium that had been the Italy of villas.1\n\nThose who argue for a crisis point to archaeological evidence such as the reorganization of villas into smaller quarters, poor repairs, and the functional repurposing of elegant rooms as signs of crisis in these settlements (Marzano, 2007, p. 199). On the other hand, Garnsey (2014. pp.86-87) contends that there is insufficient evidence to support the notion of a crisis in wine production or agriculture during the 2nd and early 3rd centuries CE. Taking an intermediate stance, Domenico Vera (2020) proposes that the crisis may have been exaggerated in historical literature and should be viewed more as a transformation. He challenges the simplistic dichotomy of decline versus prosperity and suggests that while certain localized areas, such as Thyrrenian Italy, experienced a crisis, other regions demonstrated signs of productive growth in the 2nd and 3rd centuries, reaching their peak during the Constantinian period and beyond. Among these, northern Apulia, inland Sannio, and coastal Lucania. Vera’s viewpoint aligns in this respect with Garnsey’s, as the latter believes that the decline in villas was not ubiquitous or did not occur simultaneously in all regions. In southern Etruria the number of villas diminished during the Antonine period, but they were still productive in other areas in the 3rd century—in Latium (around Rome), in the ager Falernus, and in southern Italy (Garnsey, 2014, p. 87; Lafon, 1994, p. 221; Vera, 2020, p. 221). Vera also challenges the notion that a decline in viniculture automatically implies a general agricultural decline. He suggests that the changes observed may be attributed to a shift in production rather than a decline in overall agricultural output. Cereal and animal farming, for instance, do not show signs of decay (Corbier, 1991; Spurr, 1986). The widespread abandonment of villas during this period can perhaps be understood in a different context. First, the progressive and widespread concentration of properties in the hands of senatorial families or of the imperial fiscus must have played a role in this process. Annalisa Marzano (2007, p. 215) showed how some coastal and maritime villas during the mid-empire changed ownership and were transferred to the fiscus through testamentary legacies. These villas were probably not used anymore as a residential retreat since imperial slaves or freedmen were appointed as overseer of these properties. Second, the concentration and reorganization of properties often lacked geographical continuity, posing challenges to their management. Towards the end of the 3rd century, forms of indirect tenancy increased, where plots of land were rented out to large tenants to large (conductores) and small tenants (coloni). Long-term rental contracts, known as emphytheusis, also became more common, continuing into the 4th century, and primarily targeted imperial properties that had become too extensive to be effectively managed, rather than lands that had declined due to neglect (Whittaker and Garnsey, 1997, p. 283). Vera (2020, p. 330) considers this period as a turning point in the Italian agricultural landscape. Villas, during this time, transformed into centres for the management of scattered plots of land and expanded their storage capacity for agricultural produce. For example, the villa in via Gabinia in Rome underwent modifications during the late imperial phase, including the addition of a long building identified as a storing facility (Marzano, 2007, p. 213). The concentration of properties during the late antique period did not always result in centralisation. Instead, a prominent agrarian structure that emerged during this time was the massa fundorum. It represents an agglomeration of properties with varying types, which may or may not have productive links between them (Vera, 1999). The reorganization of the rural landscape during this period also led to changes in the hierarchy of settlement patterns, resulting in a growing number of pagi and vici. These settlements were inhabited by peasants who worked the lands of the villas’ fundi or coloni. The number of vici particularly increased in southern Italy, and many of these emerging vici were connected to territories previously occupied by villas. In some instances, they were even established in the locations of abandoned villas from the 2nd to 3rd centuries, with their maximum expansion occurring in the 4th and 5th centuries.\nThe transition to the colonate system may also have been fostered by the slave crisis of the 2nd and 3rd centuries, which was indirectly caused by the reduction and slowdown of Roman military expansionism (Oliva, 1962). Karl Marx, a prominent proponent of what Kyle Harper (2013, p. 167) calls the “conquest thesis,” argued for a larger availability of slaves in the later Republic due to expansionist wars. This idea was already proposed by David Hume (1987) earlier, in his essay ‘On the Populousness of Ancient Nations’. The concept of increased slave labor driven by the demand for specific commodities, particularly wine, has been resilient in historiography and was embraced by neo-Marxists and modernist scholars such as Carandini (Harper, 2013, p. 169). The slave crisis of the 2nd and 3rd centuries cannot be solely attributed to the halt of Roman expansionism. The slave mode of production was already experiencing an internal crisis due to the inherent contradictions of the system, leading to rising supervising costs (Morley, 1996b). The impact of the slave crisis varied across different regions, with a more pronounced effect in areas where slave-run villas were prevalent, such as Thyrrenian Italy (Marzano, 2007). In contrast, northern Italy had a higher concentration of small and medium-sized farms and fewer slave-run villas (Ortalli, 1996). Furthermore, it should be also considered that not all villas exclusively relied on slave labor, as discussed earlier. Many estates employed a combination of slave labor, hired seasonal workers, and tenants for their management (Marzano, 2007, p. 229; Rathbone, 1981). The idea of a transition from slavery to a quasi-feudal mode of production has faced criticism from Harper (2013), who argues that Rome remained a slave society in the 4th century and dismisses Vera’s discussion of “slave tenancy” or “slave families” as an intermediate step towards colonate (and the medieval feudalism). He argues that these ideas are dependent on the Marxist ‘conquest thesis’ and fail to consider mechanisms of supply and demand and, more importantly, the labour market. According to the historian, the colonate is in fact a “historiographical myth” (Harper, 2013, p. 169). The primary reason for the eventual decline of slavery that he indicates is instead the decrease in demand: “as the Roman imperial system unraveled, slavery became less prominent in precisely the two sectors that made Roman slavery exceptional: sub-elite households and agricultural estates” (Harper, 2011, p. 66). Unfortunately, this dissertation is unable to contribute directly to the ongoing debate surrounding the slave crisis and the transition to the colonate system, as proposing causal inferences using archaeological environmental analyses is challenging. However, it was essential to provide a background on the situation in the Italian countryside during this period, considering that much historiography has focused on this specific debate rather than exploring other topics (more related to this work) such as crop selection. What is important to note here is that if there was an economic depression during this period, it was not solely caused by the slave crisis. As highlighted by Chris Wickham (1984), the state coffers were already suffering from tax evasion by wealthy landowners. This factor, combined with other economic dynamics and factors at play, likely contributed to the overall economic conditions of the time.\nThe second phase in the transformation of villas, as identified by Munro (2012), is the monumentalisation phase, which occurred around the 4th century. During this period, many surviving villas underwent radical architectural and decorative transformations, particularly the residential ones. Simultaneously, there was a trend of abandonment for other villas. Numerous monumentalised villas were strategically located in fertile lands with panoramic views, often in proximity to main communication systems. Examples of such villas include Casteldebole (Bologna), Faragola (Apulia), Villa del Casale (Piazza Armerina, Sicily), Villa di Massenzio (on the via Appia, Lazio, an imperial residential villa monumentalised in the 4th century), Desenzano sul Garda (Lombardy), and Masseria Ciccotti (Basilicata) (Sfameni, 2006, p. 28). In some cases, the monumentalisation involved the restructuring of previously declining or abandoned villas from the 2nd and 3rd centuries. For example, the new 4th-5th century villa at S. Giovanni di Ruoti was installed on a previously abandoned building (Buck and Small, 1994), and the same occurred with several farmsteads and minor villas in northern Apulia, where the productive areas were enhanced during the 4th-5th centuries (Posta Crusta, La Minoia, Avicenna, and more) (Vera, 1995, p. 344). Giuliano Volpe (1996) explains the simultaneous rarefaction and growth of villas as a deliberate choice, with certain villas becoming the directional centres of land properties. This viewpoint is also shared by Vera (1995, p. 194), who believes that this process is part of a general transformation of the agrarian system. The monumentalisation of villas has been attributed to the increasing preference of elite members to reside in the countryside rather than in the city (Sfameni, 2006, p. 22). The emergence of large villas, referred to as praetoria, between the 4th and 5th centuries in the Western part of the Roman Empire, has been linked to forms of self-representation by the elite (Lewit, 2003). These villas indeed do not exhibit an organic relationship with the pars rustica. Further evidence of the aristocrats’ increased urge for self-representation can be found in the letters of two writers of this period, Simmachus and Sidonius Apollinaris, which show the author’s preoccupation with issues of power and reputation (Grey, 2011, pp. 9–10). The available documentation from this period has sparked debates among historians regarding the role of slavery in rural villas, part of which has already been discussed above. Vera (2012, p. 112) is convinced that slavery was not a major component in Italian agricultural production at this point. Instead, these villas likely functioned as coordinating and stocking centres. For example, Villa del Casale in Sicily featured a large horreum frumentarium found near the entrance of the villa (Pensabene, 2010). The reorganisation of the countryside with sparser villas and the addition of stocking structures also suggests a shift in production from cash crops to cereal farming, according to Vera (Vera, 2020, p. 231). This transition is evident in locations such as Luni, where vineyards were abandoned on the hills while cereal farming persisted in the plains (Delano Smith et al., 1986). Similarly, in Farfa, wine and olive fields appear to have been converted to cereal production (Leggio and Moreland, 1986).\nIn the fifth century, the residential villa model (praetoria) faced a crisis, albeit with varying modalities and timing in different regions (Sfameni, 2012). One notable characteristic of these villas is the presence of re-use and recycling phases, indicating a continuity of occupation that extends into the early medieval period (Munro, 2012, p. 353). The presence of squatters in these abandoned villas has been hypothesized, although this notion is highly debated in more recent literature (Castrorao Barba, 2020; Munro, 2020, 2012). A revising process of the traditional paradigm of decline – a decline that Bryan Ward-Perkins (2006, pp. 87–169) could see so clearly in the material and housing culture of Late Antiquity – has been promoted by Tamara Lewit (2005; 2004, pp. 256–260; 2003) who described the transformation of the villas as a result of the different cultural and ideological values of the élite after their conversion to the Christian religion. Additionally, Volpe et al. (2009) suggest that the structural changes observed in former Roman villas are not solely a result of different values but are influenced by various factors, including the Gothic War, the crisis of central power in Rome, and other elements contributing to the aristocracies’ impoverishment. However, it is important to keep in mind an important datum: the frequency of villa re-use is relatively low compared to the number of abandoned settlements. Angelo Castrorao Barba (2014) [p.264] demonstrates that only 26% of Italian villas were reused out of a total of 1,850 case studies. Considering the extensive debate surrounding the structural changes in villas during this period, it is important to mention that this dissertation does not delve into that specific topic. For more comprehensive insights, readers are encouraged to refer to seminal works by Brogiolo (1996a), Brogiolo et al. (2005), Castrorao Barba (2020), Christie (2004), Dodd (2019), and Ripoll and Arce (2000). Importantly, research has shown how the chronology of the abandonment of Italian villas is not homogeneous. While Thyrrenian Italy seems to be the first to be in decadence, where territories are abandoned along with a demographic crisis (Vera, 2020, p. 330), in Southern Italy, for instance, villas seem to be in use at least until the 6th – 7th century. The reasons for this longer prosperity are manifold and complex. Carla Sfameni (2006, p. 167) asserts that the emergence of large residential buildings in the south in the 4th century has to indicate a positive economic trend already in the 3rd century. She criticizes the pre-1950s historiography that saw an agricultural and economic decline of southern Italy and Sicily during the imperial age, which worsened in the late imperial period. Later work by F. De Robertis (1972, 1951) and by Lelia Cracco Ruggini (1995) reevaluated southern economy suggesting opposite trends, especially for cereal farming in Apulia. Much of this positive growth has been attributed to the diversion of annona coming from Egypt to the new capital, Constantinople in the early fourth century. At this time, Italy needed a new productive centre for cereal distributions. Northern Africa, Sicily, and Apulia were obvious choices, given the large amount of available plains, and started exporting large quantities of grain (Volpe, 1996). Vera (2020, p. 330) hypothesized that the state did not promote specialisms in certain areas, rather it required produce from where there was already an abundance. Northern Apulia, notably the endpoint of a transhumance circuit, also became a core centre of wool production. Lucania et Bruttii, hosting a wide forested area, became large producers of pig. Calabria and Sicily were producing vina fiscalia (wine destined to the free imperial distributions to citizens). The destination of Apulian grain is debated, as probably until the 5th century the annona on southern Italy was only related to wine and pork production, while the grain from Apulia must have been destined to the Danube military region or Cisalpina, areas that are easy to reach on the Adriatic maritime route. Whatever the destination, this southern prolonged prosperity opened up the doors for senatorial investments. The area was more secure, a central place in the Mediterranean, close to infrastructures and Rome itself, not to mention the fact that investing in agricultural produce (especially cereals) was a good strategy in times of monetary inflation (Sfameni, 2006, pp. 168–169).\nLate antique historians have historically focused less on the topic of peasant societies, with the scholarly debate primarily centered around slaves and coloni, as mentioned earlier. The literary sources available from this period often present images of the elite, providing limited insights into the lives of small-scale peasants. At present, the most valuable source of information regarding the experiences of peasants in late antiquity can be found in the papyrological evidence from Egypt. These documents, such as petitions and legal records, offer glimpses into the lives of peasants, albeit with potential biases and limitations in terms of representativeness. In particular, the nature of these records can skew our perspective in favor of interpreting peasants in subaltern positions, as they often highlight conflicts, disputes, and struggles (Grey, 2011, pp. 4–7). One notable historiographical work that specifically examines the late Roman peasantry is Cam Grey (2011)‘s “Constructing Communities in the Late Roman Countryside.” The book explores the concept of “small politics,” emphasizing the networks of mutual support and social dynamics within peasant societies that are often overlooked in fiscal documents. Grey’s research highlights the agency of peasants, as they adeptly navigate and negotiate against aristocratic claims, particularly in the western regions. While the book primarily focuses on the social and political aspects of peasant life, it does not delve into farming strategies. Instead, it centres on legal disputes and litigations to discuss the intricate dynamics within these communities. Archaeological projects that directly target peasant and non-elite pathways, as was the case in ’The Roman Peasant Project’ (Bowes, 2020), are still missing in late antique archaeology. As a result, explicit crop selection models specific to this period have not been extensively developed. Nonetheless, scholars acknowledge a general shift from cash crops to cereal farming during this era. However, the precise pathways, timing, and spatial patterns of this agricultural transition remain unclear. Additionally, there is a lack of comprehensive, peninsula-wide perspectives on stock raising during the late antique period. While some regional studies, particularly focused on northern Apulia (Buglione et al., 2016; Buglione et al., 2015; Volpe et al., 2012; Volpe, 1996), provide insights into specific areas, there is a dearth of comprehensive synthesis works that encompass the entirety of the late Roman period.\n\n\n2.3.3 The Early Medieval phase and the 11th century\nIf late antique historians have focused on questions of slavery, tenancy, and landownership, two broad conflicting opinions have dominated the post-1950 discourse on the post-classical landscape. The first stresses continuities with the former Roman and late Roman structures and economic system, and the other emphasizes dramatic rupture from said systems. Pierre Toubert (1973) was among the first to argue for continuities in settlement patterns until the 10th-11th century CE, when sources begin to describe new types of fortified settlements called castelli or castra. Toubert (1973, pp. 321–338) used textual sources to outline the evolution from ‘dispersed households’ of the 6th-7th century CE (casalia), to 9th century CE manors (curtes), culminating in 10th-11th century CE castles (castelli). The opinion that castles originated from curtes is also shared by the historian Vito Fumagalli (1980, p. 318), who in turn believes that manors developed especially in Northern Italy in the Carolingian period. After centuries of alleged uncultivated standstill, the incastellamento (the process of creation of castles) made an agricultural revival possible, with new lands beginning to be cultivated around castles (Toubert, 1973, pp. 157–198). The scholarly focus on continuity vis-à-vis rupture also intersected with the study of the economic history in this period. Henri Pirenne ([1939] 2008) provided a long-lasting contribution to this matter in his work “Mohammed and Charlemagne”, which looked at documentary sources (primarily related to traders) and numismatic evidence. Pirenne argued against the traditional view on the end of Classical civilization, which overemphasizes the impact of 4th-6th century CE Germanic migrating tribes. Pirenne ([1939] 2008, pp. 54–70) claimed that such tribes could not have had a fundamental impact on Roman-style institutions and trading connections, extending the life of the Classical world up to the 7th century CE. He argued that life on the countryside and systems of agriculture remained the same. In this model, even the great Roman estates survived (Pirenne, [1939] 2008, pp. 75–76). Indeed, the literary sources point us to a continuity not only in assets in some cases, but also in the attitudes held by the ruling class. An example of a particularly well-known landowner in the records of the age of Theodoric, Ostrogoth king, is Theodad, his nephew. Theodad owned an extensive massa fundorum which was concentrated in Tuscia. The administration of his estates was carried out through the use of actores who were responsible for collecting rents and delivering them to him. This method of administration, as well as Procopius’ somewhat hostile portrayal of Theodad, suggests a continuation of the patterns observed within the senatorial class of the late Roman period (Vera, 2020, p. 208). The traditional view of the postclassical countryside as a landscape destroyed by continuous instabilities and warfare also continued to be challenged by recent scholarship. Arnold H. M. Jones (1964, p. 25) wrote that “the destruction caused by continued civil wars and barbarian invasions must have been immense. Cities were sacked and burned, crops destroyed, cattle driven off, and the population carried away into slavery.” However, as Tamara Lewit (2004, p. 41) points out, only a few literary sources mention destruction to agriculture in this period. Cities were likely the primary target of such violent acts. As was anticipated in the previous section, archaeologists had a different perspective on the transitional landscape and economy at the time of the collapsing villa system and Germanic migrations. The archaeological discourse emphasises that textual sources can include bias and that scholars should give more consideration to material evidence such as ceramics, settlement patterns, and architecture. For example, Bryan Ward-Perkins (2006) recognised the decline of living standards during the late Antique period through the abundance of coarse pottery, wooden houses, and the disappearance of coinage for everyday use. Chris Wickham (2005, pp. 730–735) also reports a “ceramic breakdown” and deterioration of exchange systems between the 6th and late 9th century CE, when standardised pottery types mostly disappear and only local productions survive (Brogiolo, 1996b; Giordani, 1994). Finally, Richard Hodges and David Whitehouse (1983, pp. 36–48) determined, using survey data, a decline in the number of datable sites throughout Italy and a demographic decrease between the beginning of the 5th and the end of the 6th century CE. Fabio Giovannini (2010, pp. 218–219) also argues for a demographic stagnation from the 6th century until the 12th-13th century, and reports no prolonged famines or epidemics from the 8th to the 14th century. During this period, the demographic pressure was low, particularly in rural areas. Various factors contributed to this decline. While traumatic events may have had an immediate impact on population numbers, their long-term effects are usually limited. Other factors, such as an extended period of breastfeeding for children (from 4-8 months in the Roman era to up to 2 years in the medieval period), likely influenced the number of children in rural communities. In the Roman era, it is estimated that rural families had an average of six children, whereas from the 4th to the 6th century, the average must have been around three (Ibid. 230). Despite the decrease in population, osteological analyses indicate an improvement in nutrition and diet, with fewer skeletons displaying pathologies related to these factors. Giovannini (2010) attributes this improvement to a more diverse subsistence diet compared to the Roman era. This aspect will be further explored later in this chapter. While Giovannini suggests stagnation until the 12th century, Di Muro (2020, pp. 13–14) argues for an increase in population around the time of Liutprand, the king of the Lombards, in the 8th century, following the plagues and conflicts that occurred during the Justinian era. In a status quaestionis on the discipline of Medieval Archaeology in Italy, Marco Valenti (2014, p. 123) stated that the debate was monopolized in the 1990s by the “Tuscan model” because of the larger availability of archaeological data from this region. The “Tuscan model” was put forth by archaeologists Riccardo Francovich and Hodges (2003, p. 21), who argued that Toubert’s textual model was flawed because a break had already occurred in the 6th-7th century CE, when peasant communities moved to hilltop locations and created fenced farms. The model posits that the choice of hilltops was probably dictated by necessity because after the Greek-Gothic war, unconstrained farmers decided to cluster for protection. Only later, under Carolingian rule, did villages develop hierarchies and become curtes. Lastly, the phenomenon of incastellamento in the 10th-11th century CE, merged manorial functions with landscape management (Valenti, 2014, pp. 130–131). The “Tuscan Model” clashed with the idea (popularised by Marc Bloch (1966, pp. 1–5)) that Roman villas were at the root of modern villages (Cheyette, 2008, p. 129). Following the intensification of excavations in the late 1990s, the “Tuscan model” received criticism, especially by Gian Pietro Brogiolo, who considered the case of Tuscany as an anomaly, because in Tuscany aristocratic weakness facilitated the creation of hilltop villages by free-moving farmers (Valenti, 2014, pp. 131–135). In 2004, there was a confrontation between the two sides of this debate when Francovich, Brogiolo and Valenti held an unpublished conference in Poggibonsi titled “Scavi fortunati e invisibilità archeologica” (Insegnamento di Archeologia Medievale e dell’Alto Medioevo, 2004). The title was chosen polemically after Brogiolo defined the excavations in Tuscany as circumstantially “lucky” because the structured network of Tuscan settlements must have complemented centres of power. Francovich opened the heated discussion by stating that Toubert’s continuity model (still supported by Brogiolo and other scholars) was merely based upon documentary evidence from about eight castles dated around the 10th century CE. According to Francovich, a small piece of land in Tuscany could provide better information than the entire work of Toubert (Valenti, 2014, pp. 132–136; 2009, pp. 40–42). Recently, the picture seems clearer because of historical and archaeological comparative work in the Italian peninsula. It now seems that the role of monastic foundations in the control of the countryside is undeniable because these institutions were more open to economic exchanges and agricultural exploitation than other aristocratic landowners, who were more interested in a military control of the landscape. Monasteries were often connected to a vast network of curtes, which were large tracts of land divided into two parts: the dominicum and the pars massaricia. The dominicum referred to the administrative and residential area of the estate, while the pars massaricia designated the portion dedicated to free or semi-free peasants. The origin of the manorial system of curtes has been a subject of debate among scholars. Some argue for continuities with the Roman villa-system (Francovich and Hodges, 2003), while others, as mentioned earlier, propose a significant shift in landownership patterns. However, a detailed discussion of this topic is beyond the scope of this chapter. What is important to note is that during the Lombard period, both the southern and northern duchies (although the sources richest in information are from Tuscany) provide examples of large manors already featuring a division between dominicum and pars massaricia. The figures for the average size of such estates remain uncertain, although a curtis could be valued at up to 8,000 solidi, as seen in the case of the 8th century estate of Alfiano sull’Oglio (Brescia). Nonetheless, most historians agree that curtes became more structured and widespread during the Frankish era. Wickham (2009) supports this idea, arguing that Lombard possessores were economically weaker compared to their Frankish counterparts. In contrast, Di Muro (2020) points out that this view may be biased— if most of the Lombard curtes reported in the documentary sources were private, the Carolingian estates studied so far mostly belonged to the royal fiscus. Wickham’s perspective notwithstanding, there are other historians, such as Bruno Andreolli and Massimo Montanari (1985), who highlight how corvées (unpaid labour obligations) fully developed during the Frankish period. Indeed, the demands made by landlords on peasants during the Lombard age were much more vague and general. In their view, corvées serve as indicators of a stronger control exerted by landlords over the manor. Towards the end of the Lombard era, we find references to the operae (labour) that free peasants had to perform for their landlords, as seen in the case of Totone di Campione (Gasparri and La Rocca, 2005). Although rare, there are instances of Lombard peasant obligations, which are less likely to be recorded since much of the information we have on Carolingian curtes comes from polyptychs. Polyptychs are documents that describe the lands and possessions of a landlord, which were not used during the Lombard age (Di Muro, 2020, p. 24). The role of monastic foundations in the network of curtes becomes evident when examining examples from the southern Lombard duchy of Benevento. One notable complex is Santa Sofia di Benevento, established around 760 CE by Duke Arechi II. In 774 CE, the duke bestowed upon the coenobium numerous lands and productive activities, including the saltpans of Salpi, a wood collection forest in Ascoli Satriano, a chalk mine in Nurano, various animal farms, and more (Martin, 2000). Among the properties donated to Santa Sofia was the former Roman villa of Faragola (Apulia), which underwent reorganization in the mid-7th century to enhance production and optimize spatial arrangement, particularly in handling farm produce (Volpe et al., 2009). Situated on the road to Benevento, it is likely that some of its goods were destined for that city. In 2001, Jean-Pierre Devroy (2001, p. 97) hypothesized that between the 5th and 11th century CE, ninety percent of the Italian population was living in a subsistence economy in the countryside. In general, though, the topic of rural economy is sparse in historical and archaeological literature. As Fredric Cheyette (2008, pp. 127–129) noted, only one volume in the series titled “The transformation of the Roman world” (Barceló and Sigaut, 2004) is devoted to the rural economy. The neglect of rurality by historians and archaeologists is partially to be ascribed to a “primitivism approach”2 (Castillo, 2014, p. 2), which is still significant in southern European academia. This approach argues for the return to a simpler form of economy and that this simplification is what brought on other changes in the early medieval social structure. Wickham (2005, p. 534), in talking about peasant autonomy, made an interesting point about agricultural production in the framework of the “Tuscan model”. The author claimed that after the 5th century CE, peasants did indeed operate in small circles of subsistence economy, but they had acquired more autonomy and responsibilities in farming production than in Roman times:\n\nIn a pattern of this kind, landlords are largely cut out of the productive process, for peasants make their own choices about agricultural planning and its rhythms. Almost all that changes is the type of rent, as well (of course) as its weight. In the early Middle Ages, most rents from peasants were in kind, and reflected the range of agricultural products available on any given tenant plot: the simplest type of rent structure, one that does not require any wider economic relationships to work (Wickham, 2002, p. 129).\n\nIf we exclude rents, peasants were liberated of former farming priorities, such as generating a surplus for taxation, and thus they did not have to meet external demands any longer. To provide context for this statement, it is useful to outline these former farming priorities. During the Late Roman Empire, between the rule of Septimius Severus and Diocletian, most of the Roman soldier salary (stipendium) was converted into wheat provisions. The state secured this distribution of grain to the soldiers (annona militaris) by taxing in kind the farmers. In times of peace, farmers would have been refunded of these wheat requisitions. However, in case of military necessities (as most of the times during the Late Roman age) the requisitions acted as a form of taxation (Carrié, 1989, pp. 100–102). The aforesaid concept of late antique peasant autonomy remained constant until the manor system was fully implemented in the 8th century CE. In conjunction with the development of curtes, the study of material culture also suggests that the date of economic development in the Italian countryside should sit at around the 8th-9th century CE (Valenti, 2014, p. 138), coinciding with the late Lombard and Frankish age. Adriaan Verhulst (1966) had already demonstrated the late origins of the manor system in France, but Wickham (2005, pp. 280–281) argued for the presence of manors in Northern Italy and Tuscany as well.\nIn the previous sections, we discussed the importance of crop selection models in understanding peasant choices and the subsequent economic consequences. Although explicit crop selection models are still missing for the postclassical Italian countryside, the subject has been discussed by historians at greater lengths for this period when compared to the late Roman phase. In particular, the discussion has especially focused around Tuscany, where many agrarian contracts have been studied, and Northern Italy in general, where there are more available archaeobotanical analyses. Bruno Andreolli (1981) studied 8th-10th century agrarian contracts, reporting over 500 documents for Tuscany, most of which are from 9th century Lucca. Out of these 500 contracts, 195 mention some sort of payment in kind with foodstuffs, either of vegetable or animal origin. For cereal and legumes, two types of payment are mentioned in the sources—a fixed and a partial quota. The former refers to a fixed weighted amount of produce, while the second is typically one third of the total. According to Andreolli, partial quotas are typical of plains, which were dedicated to cereal farming, whereas fixed quotas are typical of mountains, hills, and less productive areas. For instance, in the area of Garfagnana and Lunigiana the contracts from Sillano, Gorfigliano, and Cascio3 report fixed quotas. Examples of partial quotas appear in most of the 9th-10th century polyptychs from the monasteries of San Colombano di Bobbio and Santa Giulia di Brescia (Montanari, 1979, pp. 166–172). The prevalence of contracts mentioning partial quotas in highly productive areas is also evidenced by one of the most cited product in such documents, wine. This product is always requested in the form of a partial quota, most often half of the production. In addition to wine, half of the production of olives is also a common request. It is significant that the contracts mention olives always as a raw material, almost never in the form of olive oil, probably for reasons of necessity. Owning olive presses must have been a huge commodity for a farmer, and it is unlikely that all farmers had access to these structures. Besides these products, documents also mention chestnuts, hay, acorns, and other foodstuff. Payments in the form of animals are often vague in contracts, especially in the Lombard period, where the species requested are often not specified. Other times, there is instead mention of specific animals—pigs, goats, sheep, cows, and chickens. In many of these cases the animal had to be ‘annotino’, i.e. one year old. In the transition from the 8th to the 9th century, contracts became more specific, requiring only specific parts of the pig, such as the shoulder. In the 10th century these forms of payment in kind seem to fade away, probably as ‘old’ Lombard practices were gradually abandoned. More generally, Andreolli (1990) sees arboriculture as the real novelty of the early Middle Ages in Italy. According to the historian, cereal farming in this period was not very productive and the drive towards innovation and improved yields was minimal. In other words, while historiography has focused on cereals as the fundamental productive component of early medieval agrarian systems, orchards have often been ignored and thus our judgement on the profitability of agriculture of this period could only have been negative. The importance of the orchard is also understandable in view of the growing importance of urban gardens in this period. Recently, early medieval historiography is increasingly focusing on this topic, both in Italy and elsewhere (Davies, 2019; Goodson, 2018). In the early Middle Ages, the word hortus could refer to various situations: urban or suburban gardens, gardens in the dominical part of a curtis, and monastic gardens. Contrary to more pessimistic theses that read the progressive ruralisation of cities as a sign of decay compared to the Roman age, the spread of vegetable gardens in the early Middle Ages can instead be read in terms of economic rationale and practicality. Firstly, documentation especially from northern and central Italy explicitly states that vegetable gardens are not subject to taxation. The only exception to this rule were legumes, which were subject to taxation as they were regularly cultivated in the fields. Among the most requested legumes in this period, faba beans were often indicated in the taxes and agrarian contracts from S. Giulia di Brescia, Lucca, and Verona (Andreolli, 1990, pp. 184–185). Caroline Goodson (2021) in her recent work on early medieval urban gardens has pointed out that the greater diffusion of kitchen gardens in postclassical Italian cities is not a symptom of decadence, but rather a sign of a different way to conceive urban spaces4. The transition from the unproductive and ornamental gardens of the Roman era to intensively cultivated horti denotes the utilitarian mentality of early medieval man. The increased availability of space in the cities, a safer and more accessible food supply, and investment in fruit plants in the medium and long term all contributed to this phenomenon. Urban gardens spread in Rome (especially between the 6th and the 8th century), Lucca, Naples, Ferrara, Verona, and other cities. One of the scholars who has been most concerned with agricultural practices and diet in the early Middle Ages, implicitly formulating models of peasant cultivation is Massimo Montanari. Most of his observations are based on documents from northern Italy and France, and he is among the historians who have most popularised the idea of polyculture in the early Middle Ages. According to Montanari, the agricultural system shifted towards a more decentralized approach, contrasting with the centralized system of the Roman imperial period. This shift likely had implications for the types of crops cultivated during the early medieval era. In northern Italy, Montanari (1979) emphasizes the significance of “minor” grains among the cereals cultivated during this period. However, the term “minor” cereal poses some challenges, as it is used in literature to refer to different types of grains. Montanari’s definition includes rye, emmer, einkorn, spelt, sorghum, and millets as minor cereals. Other historians (Andreolli, 1990; Spurr, 1986, 1983) have employed this term to refer to cereals with lower yields and economic value, leading to the conclusion that such grains were exclusively consumed by the lower classes. In contrast, archaeobotanists like Elisabetta Castiglioni and Mauro Rottoli (2010) restrict the definition to C4 plants, specifically sorghum and millets. Some researchers exclusively apply the term to hulled wheats, while others, such as Paolo Squatriti (2019), adopt a more cautious approach and describe these grains as more “rustic.” Regardless of how one defines these grains, historians and archaeologists are in agreement that, at least in northern Italy, a transition from extensive agricultural systems to intensive polyculture took place. Notably, rye has been recognized as a significant innovation during the early Middle Ages, and its importance will be further explored later in this study. Rye is the predominant cereal in an early 10th century polyptych from Santa Giulia di Brescia, which showcases a diverse range of crops including rye, wheat, broomcorn millet, foxtail millet, barley and oats, spelt, and legumes (Montanari, 1979, p. 111). In the document, secale accounts for 2408.39 modii (39.44%), nearly double the quantity of frumentum (1234 modii, 20.21%). The idea of an early medieval peasant society based on subsistence and polyculture is also widespread among transalpine historians. Jean-Pierre Devroey (Devroey, 2019, p. 857), traces the causes of this phenomenon to the exemption of taxes, following Wickham’s (Wickham, 2005, pp. 535–547) theory of peasant autonomy:\n\nSoulagés de l’obligation de produire des surplus pour la commercialisation et le paiement de l’impôt, les paysans ont obtenu plus de liberté pour organiser leurs activités économiques suivant des logiques qui leur étaient propres.\n\nIn addition to this factor, he also considers the numerous advantages of “minor” grains against climatic adversities, which will be discussed in the next section. In particular, the French historian sees these cereals as markers of rural or “village” productions, as opposed to the seigneurial productions of common bread wheat (Devroey, 2019, pp. 864–867). This idea, as already evident from the polyptych of the powerful monastery of Brescia, likely does not apply to Italy. Although Montanari’s focus primarily revolved around cereals, legumes, and meat as the main components of the diet, it is essential to acknowledge the significant role played by arboriculture during the early Middle Ages, as previously indicated. Fruits cultivation seem to have an increased importance also in other areas of the Mediterranean—a recent archaeobotanical study (Marston and Castellano, 2023) showed how arboriculture increased through the early Byzantine period (mid-4th to mid-9th century CE) in Anatolia. Among fruits, the introduction (or popularisation) of chestnut trees was another innovation of this period. Despite being categorized as “spontaneous” fruits, chestnut trees were intentionally planted for productive purposes, a practice suggested in the Capitulare de Villis, a text from the late 8th century that offered guidance on the management of Charlemagne’s royal estates (Montanari, 1979, p. 296). Chestnuts replaced many of the spontaneous forested areas in northern Italy, in the Po valley, and in Campania (Squatriti, 2013). The fruits could be dried and stored, then ground and used as flour for bread (Castiglioni and Rottoli, 2015, pp. 55–56). Alongside the cultivation of fields and orchards, which included also vineyards and olive trees, sylvo-pastoral activities were also practised during this period. These activities often held a prominent position, particularly in the exploitation of the incoltum, referring to uncultivated areas such as woodlands, natural pastures, moorlands, and marshlands. The expansion of these uncultivated areas occurred as a result of the economic and demographic crisis that took place in late antiquity. In response to this expansion, people quickly adapted by utilising the forests for various purposes. They gathered wood for construction, collected mushrooms, herbs, and roots, engaged in hunting, and utilised streams and other water sources for fishing. The natural pastures provided grazing opportunities for sheep, goats, and cattle. Quite notably, the extension of forests during this period was often assessed based on their capacity to support pig populations. Pigs were commonly allowed to roam freely under oak trees in both plains and mountains, as they could feed on acorns (Kreiner, 2020; Montanari, 2015). Evidence from archaeobotanical analyses in various regions of Europe supports the presence of mixed farming strategies. For example, in southern France, alongside the cultivation of cereals, pulses such as faba beans, lentils, peas, and chickpeas were also grown (Ruas, 2005). This indicates a diverse agricultural system that incorporated both grains and legumes. In northern France and southern Netherlands, the transition from the Merovingian to the Carolingian period did not significantly affect crop choices. A free three-course crop rotation system5 was consistently practised, with oats, rye, barley, and bread wheat being the most commonly cultivated cereals (Bakels, 2005). This suggests a stable agricultural tradition focused on these staple crops. Additionally, the cultivation of grapes emerged as a prevalent practice for fruit production in both southern and northern France. In England, the FeedSax project showed how during the 9th to 13th century, the cultivation of low-input cereals played a significant role in enabling landowners to accumulate wealth and exert greater control over peasant populations (Hamerow et al., 2020; Hamerow and McKerracher, 2022). In the Iberian Peninsula, a recent overview of the published archaeobotanical data (Peña-Chocarro et al., 2019) has highlighted the increasing significance of fruit tree cultivation, during the early medieval period. This trend aligns with the observations made by Andreolli (1990) regarding Italy. In the Italian mainland, there is currently a lack of a comprehensive study based on archaeobotanical evidence that covers the entire region. Instead, studies have primarily focused on specific regions or shorter chronologies, providing valuable insights into localized agricultural practices (Arthur et al., 2012; Bosi et al., 2009; Rottoli, 2014a).\nIt is important to emphasize that this research has a defined upper chronological boundary, which concludes at the 11th century. This period stands out as a distinct phase that has been examined separately in the analyses of the subsequent chapters. Scholars in historical literature have underscored its transitional nature, marking significant changes and developments. One notable transformation during the 10th and 11th centuries is the full development of curtes and the evolution of some of these estates into fortified villages, which occurred at different times and with different modalities across the Italian peninsula (Toubert, 1973; Wickham, 1998, 1985). The motivations behind the construction of fortified structures by both lords and peasants were driven by defensive and economic considerations (Augenti and Galetti, 2018; Wickham, 1985). Following the so-called ‘second invasions’ by Hungarians and Saracens, many landowners, both secular and ecclesiastical, had to organise themselves as best they could in building defensive works, such as moats and palisades. According to Montanari (2014, pp. 202–205), one of the reasons for the Carolingian rulers’ loss of authority in the territory was precisely their inability to offer adequate protection. The landowners also accommodated smallholders and free farmers in their fortified holdings, serving de facto not only patrimonial but also public functions. By the 11th century, lords expanded their power to encompass larger territories and exert control even over individuals who lacked any legal ties to them; what is known as the “territorial signoria” was established. This phenomenon led to a centralisation of settlement patterns, with the rural landscape soon adapting to this new situation: cash crops, as vines and olive groves, were concentrated immediately outside the castle walls. This was followed concentrically by other crops, pastures and finally forests. Despite the significant developments in settlement patterns, the primary focus of this section remains on the phenomenon known as the “agricultural revival”, which holds particular significance in the context of this research. According to several scholars, there is evidence of a positive demographic trend emerging from the late 8th and early 9th centuries. This trend is observed through the appearance of documents related to land clearances in regions such as the Po valley, Sabina (near Farfa), and Abruzzo (Wickham, 2002, p. 128). The increasing population pressure during this time necessitated the utilisation of more resources. While certain innovations already surfaced in the 9th century, it was after the year 1000 CE that peasants, liberated from corvées, were able to optimise their time and income by engaging in activities such as the construction of new villas6, land reclamation, and the implementation of new techniques. The expansion of cultivated areas did not only affect Italy. Other areas in continental Europe and the British Isles show signs of rapid cerealisation. As early as the end of the Carolingian Age, cattle and horses as work animals became more important in north-western Europe (Hamerow and McKerracher, 2022, p. 201). In northern France, grain production increased between the 8th and the 12th centuries, as a survey on the number of grain storage structures showed (Peytremann, 2013). In addition to the progressive reduction in unpaid labour requests, Wickham (2002, p. 129) also argues for the existence of an urban market system in the 10th century, where peasants could sell their produce. In fact, documentation from this period indicates that rents were requested more in money than in kind. According to historians, agriculture was again a booming economic sector in this period, rather than being merely a base for subsistence."

    "text": "2.4 Environmental archaeology approaches in Italian archaeology\nCurrent understanding of historic landscapes has benefited greatly from the development of environmental archaeology and bioarchaeology in general, particularly with sub-disciplines such as archaeobotany and zooarchaeology. These disciplines have allowed us to re-examine assumptions about food production and consumption in the Classical age, revealing that many prior beliefs were not entirely accurate, and the reality was not as black and white as previously thought. Moreover, environmental archaeology is particularly helpful in landscape reconstructions, as it provides evidence of the historical plant and animal species present in a region. The evolution of bioarchaeologies was significantly influenced by the development of the “New Archaeology,” which emerged in the 1960s and will be discussed in more detail in the statistics section of this chapter (Section 2.5). Here, I will provide a historical overview of the disciplines, while delving into their objectives, types, and preservation modes of the remains in Chapter 3 and Chapter 4. In addition, I will also introduce other bioarchaeological proxies useful to the reconstruction of dietary regimes and climatic changes, although this research focuses solely on plant and animal remains. Peregrine Horden and Nicholas Purcell (2000, pp. 287–297) highlighted the lack of palaeobotanical and paleozoological data in the Italian peninsula. Lisa Lodwick and Erica Rowan (2022) conducted a critical overview of archaeobotanical research on Greek and Roman sites, analysing the number of sites with archaeobotanical samples published in the journal Vegetation History and Archaeobotany between 1992 and 2021, along with Environmental Archaeology between 2000 and 2021. The results indicated that North-West Europe had the highest number of sites, followed by Italy and Britain.\n\n\n\nArchaeobotanical articles with a Greek or Roman focus. Image after Lodwick and Rowan (2022, p. 599).\n\n\nArchaeobotany and other bioarchaeological disciplines are more common in prehistorical excavations, whereas zooarchaeology has a longer tradition and is also commonly practised in Italy for excavations relating to historical periods such as the Roman era and later, where ancient sources describe farming practises. Among the regions mentioned in the study above, Britain stands out with the oldest tradition and a more rigorous approach to publishing, although much of the chronological effort is dedicated to earlier periods. In addition to universities in the UK, most commercial archaeology firms collect and examine archaeobotanical samples. Similarly, archaeobotany has been extensively practiced in north-western European nations such as France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, and Switzerland since the 1980s, with commercial archaeology adding significantly to sample availability. In Italy, interest in collecting plant remains dates back to the first excavations of Vesuvian sites in the 18th century. However, most of the conversation on the Italian farmland landscape and dietary studies has relied on literary sources. This reliance on ancient textual sources, specifically referring to Italy, has led to a “false sense of security regarding ancient food and diet. Moreover, unlike some of the very rich assemblages recovered from the northern provinces, many Italian Republican and Imperial period assemblages are small, with low densities and poor preservation of remains, which often discouraged sampling efforts. As a result, outside of the Vesuvian sites, many excavations did not bother sampling” (Lodwick and Rowan, 2022, p. 603). In the 19th century, during large classical excavations like Pompeii, macroremains visible to the eye were collected and sent to natural scientists for interpretation. Wilhelmina F. Jashemski (Jashemski, 2018; Jashemski, 1999, 1979; Jashemski and Meyer, 2002), and later Annamaria Ciarallo (2001, 1992) made notable contributions to the scientific cataloguing of ancient botanical remains in Italy, focusing on the gardens of Pompeiian sites. Additionally, in the 1970s and 1980s, efforts were made to create reconstructions based on botanical materials (Castelletti, 1976, 1972; Costantini, 1983a, 1983b, 1979; Costantini et al., 1983; Follieri, 1971). Since then, several archaeobotanical laboratories have been established in Italy, including those in Modena, Lecce, Rome, and Naples, to name a few. The increased specialization in both macro- and micro-remains led to the creation of the BRAIN project, an archaeobotanical database for Italy (Mercuri et al., 2015). Although a massive task, the database provides references to published material without quantitative information. Syntheses are also becoming available, focusing on the introduction of specific species, regions, or chronologies. Some significant recent syntheses and studies include Borgongino (2006) for botanical remains in the Vesuvian area, Sadori et al. (2009) on the introduction of peach, Ucchesu et al. (2017) on plum, Caracuta (2020) and D’Auria et al. (2017) on olives, Pagnoux et al. (2013) and Celant and Fiorentino (2018) on citrus. Additionally, Castiglioni and Rottoli (2010) focused on sorghum in Northern Italy, whereas Castiglioni and Rottoli (2013) studied broomcorn millet, foxtail millet, and sorghum in North Italian Early Medieval sites. Grasso and Fiorentino (2009) provided a bibliographical reference for archaeobotanical samples from medieval Italy, and Buonincontri et al. (2017) delved into Medieval Tuscany.\nZooarchaeology, similar to archaeobotany, also underwent initial development in the 19th century, where the study of historical fauna was initially conducted by naturalists. During that time, the focus was primarily on the study of ancient animals without exploring questions of historical significance. The importance of archaeological context was often overlooked, and these studies were part of the larger debate between creationists, evolutionists, lamarckists, and darwinists (De Grossi Mazzorin, 2014). It was Pellegrino Strobel (Strobel, 1890, 1882, 1877, 1875; Strobel, 1863) who recognized the significance of faunal remains within archaeological layers, particularly in the context of Middle and Late Bronze Age Terramare. Indeed, to gain historical insights, animal bones must be studied in connection to stratigraphy. Additionally, by examining cut marks on the bones, faunal remains can be used as proxies for food processing and consumption. However, the study of faunal remains in archaeological contexts was predominantly restricted to prehistoric excavations, with these studies often appearing as mere lists attached to excavation reports. After a period of relative stagnation during which Italian archaeology moved away from natural sciences, zooarchaeology experienced a revival, particularly due to debates on the origin of agriculture and animal husbandry, especially abroad. The establishment of the Italian Association of ArchaeoZoology (AIAZ) in the early 1990s played a pivotal role in promoting the sharing of various studies through conferences. Among the notable contributions within the association, the work of Jacopo De Grossi Mazzorin was particularly remarkable, focusing on several species such as chickens, tortoises, and fish (Battafarano and De Grossi Mazzorin, 2006; Corbino et al., 2022; De Grossi Mazzorin et al., 2009; De Grossi Mazzorin, 2006, 2000; De Grossi Mazzorin, 2002; De Grossi Mazzorin and Minniti, 2009a). In recent years, zooarchaeology in Italy has seen an increase in synthesis works, surpassing the availability of such resources in archaeobotany. Noteworthy contributions include a report by Alfredo Riedel (1994), a zooarchaeologist who contributed much to the development of the discipline in Italy. The paper offers comprehensive zooarchaeological excavations data from North Eastern Italy spanning the Neolithic to the Middle Ages. Michael MacKinnon (2004) provided detailed overviews and in-depth studies of Roman period faunal data, integrating it with textual evidence. In a later work, he focused specifically on several contexts in Ostia (MacKinnon, 2014). Moreover, zooarchaeological overviews targeted specific regions like Northern Apulia, with contributions from Buglione (2007), De Venuto (2010), Buglione et al. (2016), and Volpe et al. (2012). In addition to Apulia, other Italian areas have been thoroughly studied. Petrucci (2008) presents zooarchaeological findings from Friuli Venezia-Giulia. Jacopo De Grossi Mazzorin and Claudia Minniti (2009b) compiled zooarchaeological data from Rome and Lazio, spanning from prehistory to the classical age. Additionally, a more recent work by the same authors (De Grossi Mazzorin and Minniti, 2022) covers three thousand years of samples from the Iron Age to medieval Rome. A database for medieval Italy was initially proposed by Boscato et al. (2007) at the University of Siena, but unfortunately, it was never completed. Nevertheless, one of the authors, Frank Salvadori (2015), later published some of its data. One of the first contributions that provided digital (raw) supplementary data for the Italian peninsula is in Trentacoste et al. (2021), although the database covers the first millennium BCE. Only very recently, the Schmidtova et al. (2023) RomAniDat dataset provides valuable zooarchaeological information for Italian samples from 800 BCE to 800 CE. Despite the growing importance of environmental archaeology, comprehensive syntheses of Italian regions that integrate archaeobotany with zooarchaeology are relatively scarce. However, Lentjes (2013) conducted a notable study on first millennium BCE Southeast Italy, while Rottoli (2014b) provided a comprehensive overview of early medieval northern Italy, incorporating both botanical and faunal remains. The integration of both types of sources is fundamental for a thorough understanding of landscape change in relation to agriculture.\n\n2.4.1 Diet\nThe reconstruction of ancient dietary customs is increasingly becoming more precise since the 1970s through the use of additional bioarchaeological proxies on top of plant and animal remains. Among these proxies, the analysis of carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes on human bone collagen provides useful information. This method, first applied in studies by Johann Carl Vogel and Nikolaas J. Van Der Merwe (1978; 1977), operates under the assumption that stable isotopes maintain fixed ratios in nature but can be altered by external factors, including food consumption (Heinrich et al., 2021). The carbon and nitrogen signature of each individual is then used to assess for instance if the human was consuming C3 (e.g. wheat, barley, rice, rye) or C4 (e.g. maize, sorghum, millet, sugarcane) plants, if their diet included terrestrial and marine resources, etc. In particular, the ratio of 13C/12C (∂13C) reflects the proportion of different kinds of plants, while the ratio 15N/14N (∂15N) is indicative of protein consumption (animal foods, mother’s milk, aquatic foods). Higher ∂13C values indicate a higher consumption of C4 plants, while higher ∂15N values reflect a diet that is more based on animal proteins than plants. The interpretation of the isotope ratios is not straightforward, as many confounding elements can be misleading (De Angelis et al., 2020). For instance, having a baseline of the meals the person was eating is helpful. Some fish also have signatures similar to C4 plants, and different animal feeds can alter the isotope values of, for example, a cow, which in turn affects the isotope value of the human being under investigation (Twiss, 2019). The isotope ratios can also be additionally affected by farming practises. It is necessary to understand whether animals were consuming wheat from fields that had been fertilised with dung—human stable isotopes are in fact the product of the complete food chain (what we ate, what was eaten by what we ate, etc.). If so, it is likely that nitrogen was being recycled (Heinrich et al., 2021).\nIn recent times, scholars have been engaged in the compilation of isotope databases. The IsoArch database, created by Kevin Salesse et al. (2018), encompasses information dating from the 12th century BCE to the 8th century CE, with a geographical focus on the Graeco-Roman world. Another significant database, the Compendium Isotoporum Medii Aevi (CIMA), presented in Carlo Cocozza et al. (2022), contains data from both Italy and Europe, spanning the period around 500 CE to 1500 CE. By utilizing both the IsoArch and CIMA databases, Cocozza et al. (2022) made noteworthy observations regarding dietary patterns in different regions of Italy. In northern Italy, there appears to be an increase in the consumption of C4 plants between 200 CE and 500 CE. Meanwhile, in central Italy during the same period, there seems to be a decline in protein consumption. These findings corroborate localised studies of stable isotopes conducted in specific regions of the Italian peninsula during the Classical and post-Classical periods. In particular, isotopic evidence has been informative on the significance of marine resources in Roman Italy, especially in areas located close to coastlands as Pompeii or Herculaneum. These findings were not readily evident in traditional zooarchaeological studies, as fish remains are not frequently found on archaeological sites (see Chapter 4 for sampling biases). Finally, the application of stable isotopes has also proven instrumental in shedding light on non-elite diets (Craig et al., 2009; De Angelis et al., 2020; Iacumin et al., 2014; Killgrove and Tykot, 2018, 2013; Rowan, 2022; Soncin et al., 2021).\n\n\n2.4.2 Climate\nEnvironmental archaeology has not only facilitated the reconstruction of consumption and production patterns but also contributed to various other topics. Archaeobotany, for instance, utilizes not only macroremains but also microremains such as pollens or non-pollen palynomorphs (NPP) to reconstruct historical landscapes. These microremains serve as proxies for paleoclimate, providing valuable insights into past environmental and vegetation changes (Seppä and Bennett, 2003). Numerous works have explored this direction, continuously publishing syntheses of the obtained data. Particularly, palynology has been instrumental in understanding climatic fluctuations during the first millennium CE. The role of climate in historical landscapes gained considerable scholarly attention, especially when the 16th century CE marked the beginning of a recognized climatic “anomaly”, later known as the “Little Ice Age” (Cheyette, 2014). As the discipline of paleoclimatology advanced, three distinct climatic anomalies were identified in the first millennium. These events are referred to as the “Roman Warm Period” (~ 250 BCE - 200/400 CE), the “Late Antique Little Ice Age” (~ 536-660 CE), and the “Medieval Warm Period” (~ 900-1300 CE).\nThe Roman Warm Period, also known as the “Roman Climatic Optimum”, has been characterized as a period of warm and stable conditions in Italy, Southern, and Northern Europe from approximately 200 BCE to 200 CE (Ljungqvist, 2010; Van Limbergen and De Clercq, 2021). Although the exact timing of this climatic event remains debated due to various proxies providing different chronologies, evidence suggests relative climatic stability during this period. Some studies have linked this stability to Roman expansionism and positive trends in agricultural production (Harper, 2017). However, it is essential to note that linking historical events to climatic trends is not universally accepted among scholars. Thus, in this review, I will strictly focus on the climatic evidence. Recent research using stalagmites from Bàsura cave in Northern Italy indicates a warmer and increasingly humid climate during the Roman Warm Period, followed by a wetter climate around 350 CE (Hu et al., 2022). Furthermore, evidence from various sources includes stable solar activity between 200 BCE and 100 CE, followed by a cooling phase from the 2nd century CE. This cooler phases seems to continue up to 270 CE, as indicated by Greenland ice cores (McCormick et al., 2012). Additionally, evidence shows increased precipitation variability after 250 CE (Büntgen et al., 2011). Reduced sea ice during the Roman Warm Period (Shi et al., 2022) and warmer sea surface temperatures from the 1st to the end of the 5th century in Sicily (Margaritelli et al., 2020) further support this climatic phase. During this period, the spread of viticulture in Britain suggests warmer temperatures (Van Limbergen and De Clercq, 2021). While some scholars describe the period from 200 BCE to 150 CE as “warm, wet, and stable” (Harper, 2017, p. 44) across the Mediterranean, others emphasize the more regional nature of precipitation phenomena and the need to avoid generalisations (Haldon et al., 2018).\nClimate reconstructions show a lasting, large-scale cooling phase in the Northern Hemisphere in the 6th and 7th century CE, defined in literature as “Late Antique Little Ice Age” or “Dark Age Cold Period” (Eisenberg et al., 2015, pp. 48–49). Three volcanic events in 536, 540 and 547 CE caused a spread of aerosol particles in the stratosphere, screening the sunlight and causing sea-ice extension (Büntgen et al., 2016). Cassiodorus, praetorian prefect under the Ostrogothic king Theoderic the Great, accounts about a “bluish” sun and mysterious weather in 536 CE: “we have had a winter without storms, a spring without mildness, and a summer without heat […] The seasons have changed by failing to change” (Cassiodorus, 1886, p. 519). The bipolar ice core record of volcanism, based on Greenlandic and Antarctic ice caps, confirms high quantities of sulphate deposits in the atmosphere dated 534±2 CE (Sigl et al., 2013). Dendrochronological studies recorded a climatic deterioration in the Mediterranean region between 536 and 660 CE ca., with temperatures cooling down to 1.5°C compared to the average (Büntgen et al., 2016). The late antique climatic anomaly lasted until the 660 CE, around the time in which solar irradiance must have touched its minimum (Steinhilber et al., 2009).\n\n\n\nLeft image. Evidence of LALIA across the Northern Hemisphere. Image after Büntgen et al. (2016). Right image. Total Solar Irradiance during the last two millennia. Image after Steinhilber et al. (2009).\n\n\nIn Northern Italy, another important climatic event dated 589 CE has been the focus of many studies: the so-called Paul the Deacon deluge, termed after the author of Historia Langobardorum who describes it as the major rainfall since Noah’s times (Paul the Deacon et al., 1878, p. 127). For a long time, the precipitations of the 589 CE have been considered to be the main cause of hydrological change in the Italian north-east (Squatriti, 2010, pp. 799–801). Other scholars have reduced the importance of the 589 CE flooding, emphasizing how the process of riverbed aggradation had already started before the 4th century CE, in Roman times (Cremonini et al., 2013, pp. 170–1; Marchetti, 2002). The two main Italian rivers, the Adige and the Po, were extremely lively in the first half of the first millennium CE, as some prevention works on the river banks show (Squatriti, 2010, p. 816). Evidence of the 589 CE flooding can be found stratigraphically in the alluvial sediments, hard to recognize outside the region of Emilia-Romagna, the alluvial basin of the Po river. However, alluvial layers have been documented in Lombardy, Veneto and Tuscany (Cremonini et al., 2013, p. 175; Zanchetta et al., 2021). In low plains, the consequences of flooding are more visible, with the creation of marshlands, the advancement of the coastline and the development of lagoons (Brogiolo, 2015, p. 50). The study of pollen, NPPs, and seeds showed indeed evidence of devastating floods in Northern Italy during late antiquity (Bosi et al., 2019; Squatriti, 2010). The waterlogging from such climatic circumstances is used as evidence for the observable return to subsistence economy in some (either rural or urban) centres and for the abandonment of others. Some case studies dated between the 5th and the mid-8th century CE (Benito et al., 2015; Cremonini et al., 2013; Sadori et al., 2016) provide a picture of a generally cold and wetter/humid climate. The sites show the advancement of the forest (Cheyette, 2008, pp. 163–164), with broad-leaved trees (in prevalence deciduous, of the Quercus sp.). At S. Michele di Trino (Caramiello et al., 1999), however, pollens related to forest coverage slightly decrease, although still in elevated proportions (43%). The woodland encroachment is consistent with the farming collapse following the Greek-Goth war (535-554 CE) described by Neil Christie (Christie, 2006, pp. 487–491). Despite the continuity of use of wheats of the Triticum/Avena group, the sites show a general spread of grains, as barley (Hordeum vulgare) and rye (Secale cereale), that are more resistant to cold weather and rain. Pollens from Modena, in the Po valley, show a picture of a sparse forest (49,4%), with many wet land plants (28%) and a marked reduction of man’s activity (Bosi et al., 2019; Bosi et al., 2011). In the mountain site of Sant’Antonino di Perti, pasture grass pollens are prevalent, in relation to pastoralism (Arobba and Murialdo, 2001).\nThe third climatic anomaly of the first millennium, known as the “Medieval Warm Period”, occurred after the late antique cooling phase, characterized by increased temperatures. This warming phenomenon reached its peak in the 11th century CE, with temperatures rising approximately 1.5-2°C above the average. The “Medieval Warm Period” spanned from around ∼900 to 1350 CE (Diaz et al., 2011; Graham et al., 2011), lasting for about five centuries in some regions of the Northern Hemisphere (Devroey, 2001; Nanni, 2017). The period featured generally mild weather, although some variability was observed. Tree-ring-based temperature reconstructions in North-eastern Italy confirmed warm summers during the 10th and 11th centuries, followed by cooler temperatures in the 12th century (Serre-Bachet, 1994). Furthermore, evidence from Greenland ice cores demonstrate glaciers retreat in the same period in Europe and other parts of the world (Grove and Switsur, 1994). In addition, a reconstruction of the past North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), which favours the flow of warm air, has shown positive values in the Middle age, with a peak in the 1050 CE (Trouet et al., 2009). The concept of a “Medieval Warm Period” or “Medieval Climatic Optimum” has been challenged in recent years, with some scholars referring to this period as a climatic “anomaly”7 (Xoplaki et al., 2016).\n\n\n\nDiachronic comparison of several terrestrial environmental proxies of central-eastern Mediterranean. After Sadori et al. (2016, p. 180).\n\n\nFollowing the increase in temperatures, it was possible to grow common Mediterranean plants at higher temperatures and in northern areas. For instance, grape seeds have been found in England and fig trees were grown in Northern Italy (Mann, 2002, p. 515). Pollen analyses confirm a positive trend in agricultural production in the 10th and 11th century CE, leading to landscape changes. In Nogara (Marchesini et al., 2011), the Quercus forest was replaced by fields of cereals (3.2-16.1%), hemp, and grape vine, with high percentages of pasture grass (14-33.9%). In S. Michele di Trino, the woodland coverage reached a minimum of 15%, mostly consisting of Tilia, Ostrya, and Fraxinus, while wetland plants increased, likely in relation to changes in the Po river course. At the site of Sant’Agata Bolognese (Gelichi et al., 2014), there was a reduced presence of conifers (3%) and an introduction of Mediterranean trees like Quercus ilex. The pollen analysis revealed an increase in anthropic plants up to 27%, and besides cereals (18%), fruits, and nuts were cultivated. In Parma (Bosi et al., 2012), the pollen sediments from a cesspit showed a rich variety of cereals and legumes, including the Triticum/Avena group, the Hordeum group, rye, broomcorn millet, and broad bean. In each site, humans are the main driving force of landscape change."

    "section": "3.1 Introduction",
    "text": "3.1 Introduction\nThis chapter provides an overview of the archaeobotanical materials used for this research project. Literature review provided an historical overview of the discipline, while this chapter discusses the goals, types, and preservation modes of the remains. In addition to discussing general aspects of the discipline, this chapter also provides a more detailed examination of the specific data available for this research project, which have been stored in the database. The database storing procedures are described in Chapter 5.\nThe objective of archaeobotany is to recover, identify, and document plant remains from archaeological sites to reconstruct past vegetation dynamics, human-environment interactions, and food production and consumption patterns. Archaeobotany can also be referred to as “palaeoethnobotany”, a term especially prevalent in North America. Although the word “palaeoethnobotany” places a stronger stress on the human and ethnic interaction with plants (Hastorf and Popper, 1988), the two words are used mostly interchangeably (Hastorf, 1999) as European archaeobotanists share the same objectives. It is important to emphasise that the term “palaeobotany” is not a valid synonym for archaeobotany, as it refers to the study of past evolution and adaptations of plants, and this discipline is not concerned with human-environment interactions (Fuller and Lucas, 2014). In Classical archaeology, some of the archaeobotanical research questions can also be inferred from historical literature. This is problematic, as the evidence often contradicts what is said in texts; Pearsall (2015, p. 27) remarks how the discipline works using an archaeological approach, not an historical one. Furthermore, the domain of archaeology stretches far beyond the chronological range of textual history. In the archaeological record, four types of botanical remains can be identified—macroremains, pollen grains, phytoliths (inorganic elements found in leaves, stems, and other parts of plants), and starches (formed by amylose or amylopectin polymer aggregates) (Pearsall, 2015). Most archaeobotanical studies in Italy deal with macroremains and pollen, although this research will only focus on the former."

    "section": "3.2 Macroremains",
    "text": "3.2 Macroremains\nMacroremains such as seeds, nutshells, fruit pips, and charcoal (wood preserved after carbonisation) are visible to the naked eye (> 0.25 mm). It is possible to recover macrofossils—in situ, by screening using sieves, and by flotation. In situ collection is possibly the most problematic, as it relies on the experience of the excavator and favours larger finds. In addition, light conditions and the colour of the soil might influence the ability to visualise seeds and charcoal remains. A solution to this problem is to use screening techniques, and choosing an appropriate mesh size can limit the bias for underrepresented taxa (e.g. particularly small seeds). Often, sieves of different mesh sizes are used at the same time for the purpose of eliminating as much soil as possible from the soil sample. In addition to dry screening, archaeologists also use wet screening. Wet screening refers to the practice of pouring water onto the sieve. It differs from wet sieving, which requires the submersion of seeds in a bucket with water that is gently agitated. In any case, adding water to the sieve can be counter-productive, as wetting might destroy the seeds if they are charred (White and Shelton, 2014). One of the most common types of recovery is by flotation, which encompasses several techniques, each based on the principle that water is denser than charred material. Flotation can be either manual or machine-assisted. The former refers to wet sieving, where seeds are submerged in water and the ones that float are recovered using a mesh. Tools and machines have been also developed for flotation, including the hand-pump (which does not require electricity) and other machine-assisted tools (see Figure 3.1) that use water pressure and aeration to separate the seeds from soil. Flotation also allows the recovery of other small-sized archaeological material, including fish and bird bones, and mollusca (Jarman et al., 1972; Turney et al., 2005, p. 125; Williams, 1973). After separating the seeds from the soil, seeds can be identified and quantified. For the identification, researchers use fossil reference collections and photographs (Turney et al., 2005).\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Example of a flotation machine. In the image, the so-called ‘Siraf’ type flotation machine, used at Pantanello (Basilicata). Image after Costantini and Costantini Biasini (2018, p. 373).\n\n\n\n3.2.1 Sampling\nA sample is a smaller subset of elements from a population. In statistics, a population is the entire set of elements which we can draw inferences from. Often, it is not possible to know how large is the population, which is then called universe. Whether consciously or not, archaeology has always dealt with sampling. Much of the archaeological record has been lost or destroyed in time, and what we are able to study is a smaller portion of what once was present (Drennan, 2010, p. 80). If we consider the entire statistical population what is currently available to the archaeologist, it would be possible to sample for instance each bucket of soil excavated and count the total number of seeds found. This will certainly provide the most accurate information, although it is almost never possible in real life situations. Common constraints are time, funding, number of excavators, etc. It is then up to the archaeologist to decide how to collect samples, which will be biased by definition since they will not reflect reality. Why bother with sampling then? Archaeobotanical macroremains can be smaller than 1 mm and sampling can provide more information than collecting seeds with the naked eye (i.e. no sampling) (Orton, 2000, p. 148). Moreover, an effective and robust sampling strategy can limit bias as far as possible and try to return meaningful samples. Depending on the context, resources and individual decisions, several possibilities are available—interval sampling, probabilistic sampling, judgemental sampling, total sampling, or no sampling at all (Jones, 1991). The first, interval (or systematic) sampling, consists in sampling at regular intervals. The intervals can be defined in space (samples evenly spaced out in a grid), in time (sampling every tot. minutes or every \\(n\\)-th bucket), or in the laboratory using a riffle box (a machine designed to divide samples). One drawback of this method is that the regularity in sampling might correspond to a regular pattern in the data, which may bias the results. Probabilistic sampling is a method often advocated for, but rarely used. This type of sample has the advantage of allowing the researcher to draw statistical inferences on the data collected, for instance to calculate the margin of error and confidence intervals. The simplest form of probabilistic sampling is random sampling, for example randomly choosing to sample a square from a grid or a bucket from a series of buckets. Another approach to random sampling is cluster sampling, which requires a prior division of the sampling population into clusters (e.g. by context, area, etc.) and then randomly select some of these clusters during excavation (Orton, 2000). One of the problems that may arise from random and cluster sampling approaches is that of spatial autocorrelation. As Waldo Tobler (1970) puts it:\n\nThe first law of geography: Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.\n\nOther forms of sampling include judgemental sampling, a feature based approach and total (or blanket) sampling which consists in taking a certain amount of soil from each excavated context. Both methods will be discussed more in detail below. Finally, an excavation can have no sampling at all. Most of the archaeobotanical samples with macroremains recorded in the database were collected using different types of visual sampling, not always made explicit by the authors. Visual sampling occurs when archaeologists can visually see or expect (i.e. judgemental sampling) macroremains in the feature they are excavating. Common features from which samples are usually collected include—pits, hearths, filled anforae, etc. But “how can one argue that the contents of a pit reflect activities involving food specific to that context, if one has not examined samples from floor deposits into which the pit was dug, or the deposits overlying it?” (Pearsall, 2015, p. 75). Lennstrom and Hastorf (1995) lament “feature biases” in many archaeological excavations, as paleobotanists are often called after archaeologists have already recovered materials from specific site features. The authors call for a general misconception in the goal of archaeobotany—to collect as many macroremains as possible. This strategy is, in fact, not very informative about the relationships between plant remains and stratigraphic units, and the general deposition patterns in the site. For instance, Jones et al. (1986) were able to reconstruct the functions of structures and the methods of crop storage at Assiros, northern Greece, through a thorough extensive sampling. Pearsall (2015, p. 74) recommends a “blanket sampling” strategy, which consists in collecting samples for flotation from each stratigraphical unit. The advantages of blanket sampling are manifold:\n\nIf in theory sampling from strategical features (e.g. hearths) maximizes the chances of recovering more macrobotanical remains, in practice this is not always the case. For instance, if a hearth was used on a regular basis, it could possibly have been cleaned of ashes frequently, and the excavator might have more luck sampling around it.\nIncluding the collection of samples from each layer in the excavation leads an uniform and standardised procedure, reducing the variation across samples.\nBlanket sampling allows an easier reconstruction of deposition patterns and of stratigraphic units relations as stated above. For instance, one can analyse differences in macroremains densities across samples.\n\nIn addition to choosing the most efficient sampling strategy, sample size is also a problem that has been discussed in archaeobotany. The sample size, often indicated in litres in archaeological reports, can be constant or variable depending on the context. The size can have important repercussions on the richness of the sample, a topic that will be dealt with more extensively in the chapter discussing the methods used in this thesis. In short, a particularly small sample size can affect the number of species found. In particular, rare species may be either not represented or under-represented (Pearsall, 2015, p. 160). While archaeobotanists have advocated for more specific sampling strategies for over 40 years, very few of the Italian excavations in this dataset applied blanket or probabilistic sampling, and collecting samples from features is still the most common practice.\n\n\n3.2.2 Preservation\nThere are several ways in which seeds can be preserved, among them charring (or carbonisation), mineralisation, waterlogging, desiccation, metal oxide preservation and as imprints in ceramics (Fuller and Lucas, 2014). This section will focus only on grain preservation, excluding wood remains, as anthracological data (charred wood) has not been recorded on the database. The mode of preservation has a strong effect on the species of plants that can be found in the archaeological level. Cereals and nuts have higher chances of being preserved by charring, while fruit pips, herbs and spices are most common in waterlogged sediments. Nuts, fibrous and oil-rich plants are also equally preserved under water. Desiccation greatly preserves several parts of a plant, although it occurs very rarely (Veen, 2018, p. 71). These factors influence the representation of plants in the archaeological context, and one must be aware that the most identified taxa may represent the plants that had the best chance of being preserved. The most represented taxa therefore do not necessarily coincide with the most numerous or used plants at the site being investigated (Pearsall, 2015, p. 42). Figure 3.2 and Figure 3.3 show how different preservation methods affect the representation of a taxon.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Preservation mode of species with more than five occurrences in northwestern Europe in the Roman period [c= charred, m = mineralised, w = waterlogged, u = unknown]. Image after Livarda (2018).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Preservation mode of three plant groups in medieval Britain [black = charred, white = waterlogged, grey = mineralised]. Image after Veen et al. (2013).\n\n\nA final comment must be made on the state of preservation of botanical macrofossils. Regardless of how the seeds have been preserved from deposition to the time of excavation, the state of preservation of individual seeds may also be affected by mechanical actions such as fragmentation or erosion. Indeed, it is not uncommon for an archaeologist to find seeds that are only partially intact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Fragmentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Erosion\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Several stages of fragmentation and erosion of seeds of Sparganium erectum. Image after Jones et al. (2007, p. 79)\n\n\n\n3.2.2.1 Charring\nCarbonisation is the most common way of finding seeds when excavating an archaeological site, most notably when using flotation on the samples. Carbonisation occurs when seeds (or other botanical materials) are exposed to fire at not excessively high temperatures and under anaerobic conditions so that the combustion process is not completed. Other factors include the proximity to the fire source, fuel type and elements associated to the seed (i.e. chaff and straw) (Turney et al., 2014, p. 93). Several experiments have been carried out to understand the way in which carbonisation takes place and for a review of the literature on this topic, readers can refer to Pearsall (2015, pp. 41–42). Charred seeds lose their original colour (turning black), but mostly retain their morphology although slightly changing their dimension. The chance of preservation is particularly high considering that charred material is not attacked by bacteria or fungi (Weiss and Kislev, 2007).\n\n\n3.2.2.2 Mineralisation\nMineralisation is a natural process that leads to the replacement of organic material with inorganic material. Through phosphatisation, soft tissue is replaced by calcium-phosphate minerals that preserve the morphology of the seed (Murphy, 2014). Mineralisation can also occur because some plants are particularly mineral-rich, and the phenomenon takes place prior to deposition. This is known as biomineralisation (Messager et al., 2010). For instance, mineralised seeds can be found in latrines or cesspits (Veen et al., 2013, p. 164).\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: Examples of charred and mineralised seeds from Herculaneum. Image after Rowan (2017).\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2.3 Waterlogging\nOrganic material maintained in a wet environment under very low oxygen levels (anaerobic conditions) can be preserved as the activity of micro-organism is low or entirely absent. Examples of wet environments include natural ones (lake, riverine, marine sediments, marshes, bogs, etc.) or man-made (pits, latrines, wells, ditches, etc.) (Spriggs, 2014). Waterlogged seeds do not degrade markedly, but their starch, sugar and protein content is low and their colour is dark (Weiss and Kislev, 2007).\n\n\n3.2.2.4 Desiccation\nThis phenomenon is limited to very arid regions (mostly Egypt, some areas of China and Spain), where the complete desiccation of the organic material prevents microbial decay. Where plant material is preserved through drying, the preservation is remarkable; for instance, even aDNA survives in desiccated seeds (Veen, 2018, p. 58).\n\n\n3.2.2.5 Metal oxidation\nPlant material can be preserved if found in proximity to metals. Metal oxides when the soil is moist, creating a toxic environment for microbial activity.\n\n\n3.2.2.6 Ceramic imprints\nThe imprints of seeds and plants on the wet clay can help the investigator recognise the morphology of the seed and identify the plant, however the organic material is not preserved and the marks on the pottery are the only visible remains (Schepers and Vries, 2022).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Cereal chaff and straw in a fired clay fragment from Pantanello (Basilicata).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Two-row barley triplet against a fresh triplet from reference collection.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: Examples of ceramic imprints.

Common features from which samples are collected include pits, hearths, and filled anforae. The pitfalls of this type of sampling have already been outlined in this chapter. In addition to differences in sampling strategies, recovery techniques also differed between reports, which can lead to some taxa being underrepresented. It was not possible to quantify how many sites used flotation or dry sieving, as this information was lacking, especially from older reports. On the other hand, the mode of preservation has been indicated in most cases, with charring being the most common. The list of samples that included the preservation mode in their reports is listed in Table 3.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.2:  Preservation mode of the archaeobotanical samples in the database.

Specifically, there is a higher representation of samples from northern Italy, indicating a greater focus on archaeological investigations in that region. Conversely, certain areas in the south of Italy show a relatively lower representation of archaeobotanical sampling. Additionally, there is a notable lack of archaeobotanical data from central Italy during the investigated period. These spatial discrepancies in the distribution of archaeobotanical samples suggest varying degrees of research emphasis and archaeological investigations across different regions of Italy. The abundance of samples from northern Italy may be attributed to a combination of factors, such as research interests and more specific factors influencing the preservation and recovery of plant remains in that region. In contrast, the lower representation of archaeobotanical sampling in specific areas of the south and center might indicate a relative scarcity of archaeobotanical investigations or limited attention paid to the study of plant remains in those regions during the studied period. These observations are based on the available archaeobotanical samples and may be influenced by various factors affecting archaeological investigations in different regions. The geographical variability in the number of available samples also concerns the different topographic features, including coasts, plains, hills, and mountains. The topographical distribution of samples can be visually explored in Figure 3.8 and Table 3.3, which indicate that most samples are located at low elevations, either on plains or coasts. This suggests that archaeological investigations and archaeobotanical sampling have primarily focused on these areas. However, a more detailed examination of the relationship between altitude and plant occurrence is provided in the results chapter, where altitude is modeled against the presence of plants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.3:  Topographical distribution of archaeobotanical samples. \n \n  \n    Topography \n    Samples \n  \n \n\n  \n    Coast \n    54 \n  \n  \n    Hill \n    26 \n  \n  \n    Mountain \n    26 \n  \n  \n    Plain \n    71 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.8: Topographical distribution of the archaeobotanical samples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCostantini, L., Costantini Biasini, L., 2018.

    "text": "4.1 Introduction\nThis chapter provides an overview of the zooarchaeological materials used for this research project. Literature review provided an historical overview of the discipline, while this chapter discusses the goals, types, and preservation modes of the remains. In addition to discussing general aspects of the discipline, this chapter also provides a more detailed examination of the specific data available for this research project, which have been stored in the database. The storing procedures are described in Chapter 5.\nThe objective of zooarchaeology is to recover, identify, and document animal remains from excavated archaeological sites to reconstruct the relationship between humans and other animals, as well as farming practices and food patterns. The name of the discipline has been debated since its origins, with the first reference to its practitioners being “zoologico-archaeologists”. Mirroring the anthropological perspective of studying animal remains to gain insights into human behaviour, the discipline is widely referred as “zooarchaeology” especially in the Americas. The term “archaeozoology” is preferred by practitioners who emphasise the biological nature of faunal remains; especially in Africa and Eurasia. Italian scholars refer to the discipline as archeozoologia, reflecting this tradition. More alternatives are also available, including “ethnozoology”, “paleoethnozoology” and “osteoarchaeology” (Clutton-Brock, 2017; Reitz and Wing, 2008, pp. 4–5). Because this thesis deals with humans’ relationship with animals for economic and historical purposes, the term “zooarchaeology” will be used throughout this volume. The importance of archaeology in making inferences about historical environmental questions has already been emphasized in Chapter 3; as with archaeobotany, although textual sources can be useful in answering historical questions, zooarchaeology is essential for verifying and complicating our understanding of the past. Zooarchaeology studies both vertebrate and invertebrate remains. Depending on the research questions, a zooarchaeologist may focus on domestic/wild animals, on a single species, on a specimen (i.e., a single bone) at different scales ranging from a stratigraphic unit to an entire region (Lyman, 1994). The recovery methods for animal bones include in situ examination, screening with sieves, and flotation techniques. All these techniques have already been outlined in Chapter 3. However, it is important to address again the underlying challenges. Visual collection tends to favour larger bones, potentially leading to the loss of smaller finds if not properly sieved. In contrast, flotation proves particularly useful for the recovery of remains such as fish, birds, and mollusca. For instance, fish otoliths, which are structures found in the inner ears of fish, can be challenging to visually identify and are often successfully recovered through flotation. In Figure 4.1, the impact of screening and flotation techniques on the recovery of fish vertebrae from the Kings Bay site, located on the Atlantic coast of Georgia, United States, is illustrated.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Influence of screening and flotation techniques on the recovery of fish vertebrae at the Kings Bay site on the Atlantic coast of Georgia, United States.

    "section": "4.2 Sampling",
    "text": "4.2 Sampling\nAlthough faunal remains are generally more abundant and easily identifiable compared to botanical remains, the number of recovered remains at a given archaeological site is inevitably influenced by the chosen sampling strategy. As emphasized by Terry O’Connor (2000, pp. 28–30), it is crucial to establish a sampling strategy prior to commencing excavation. The author outlines three potential strategies that can be employed in the field:\n\nAll-from-all: This strategy involves collecting all bone fragments encountered in every context or deposit within the excavation area. It aims to capture a comprehensive representation of the faunal assemblage without selective biases.\nSome-from-all: In this strategy, a selective approach is taken, and only a portion of the bone fragments from each context or deposit is collected. The selection may be based on specific criteria, such as bone size, element type, or preservation quality. This strategy allows for a more manageable sample size while still providing valuable faunal data.\nSome-from-some: This strategy combines elements of the previous two approaches. It involves selecting certain contexts or deposits for comprehensive sampling (similar to the all-from-all strategy) while applying a selective approach in other areas (similar to the some-from-all strategy). This strategy allows for a balance between comprehensive coverage and practical constraints.\n\nAs highlighted in the previous chapter, various drawbacks of different sampling strategies have been discussed, including the limitations of blanket, judgemental (or feature-based), and random approaches. These strategies are influenced by factors such as research questions, time constraints, and economic considerations. The blanket approach, which involves collecting all the bone fragments from every context without any selective criteria, may lead to an overwhelming amount of material to analyse. This can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, especially when dealing with large or complex archaeological sites. The judgemental or feature-based approach relies on selecting specific contexts or features for sampling based on prior knowledge or assumptions about their potential significance. While this approach may provide focused data collection, there is a risk of bias and overlooking important information from other contexts or areas of the site. The random approach involves selecting samples in a random or systematic manner to ensure unbiased representation. However, this approach may not effectively capture the full range of variability within the site and may result in missing important data. As the sampling effort increases, the probability of encountering rare species also tends to rise. By collecting a larger quantity of bone fragments or applying a more comprehensive sampling approach, researchers increase their chances of capturing a broader range of faunal remains, including those that may be less common or uncommonly preserved (Reitz and Wing, 2008, p. 110). Ultimately, the choice of a sampling strategy depends on the specific research questions, available resources, and logistical constraints of the excavation project. By considering these factors, researchers can determine the most appropriate approach to ensure the collection of meaningful and representative faunal data within the given constraints."

    "section": "4.3 Preservation",
    "text": "4.3 Preservation\nThere are several taphonomic processes that influence the preservation of faunal remains in archaeological contexts. While providing an exhaustive list is beyond the scope of this dissertation, a synthesis presented by O’Connor (2000) offers valuable insights into these processes:\n\nBiotic processes encompass the pre-death factors that influence the composition of the animal population in a specific time and space. These processes include ecological interactions, competition, predation, and disease dynamics among living organisms.\nThanatic processes refer to the events that lead to the death and subsequent deposition of the animal remains. They can be natural, such as natural mortality or predator-prey interactions, or human-induced, including hunting, butchery, and discard practices. Other animals, such as scavengers, can also contribute to the deposition of faunal remains.\nPerthotaxic processes involve the movement and destruction of bones before their incorporation into a deposit. This includes various agents such as fluvial action (river currents), scavenging by animals, and human waste management practices that can alter the distribution and integrity of skeletal elements.\nTaphic processes encompass the chemical and physical agents that act upon the bones after burial. These processes can either contribute to the preservation or degradation of bones. Factors such as soil chemistry, burial environment, and exposure to moisture, acidity, or other corrosive agents play a role in bone preservation.\nAnataxic processes represent recycling processes in which buried bones are re-exposed to external agents such as fluvial action, sub-aerial weathering, trampling, or other attritional processes. These processes can accelerate, redirect, or even halt the physical and chemical changes initiated by taphic processes.\n\nUnderstanding these taphonomic processes is essential for interpreting faunal remains in archaeological contexts. They provide insights into the complex journey of animal bones from their formation to their recovery and subsequent analysis, shedding light on the potential biases and alterations that may affect the assemblage."

    "section": "4.4 Counting bones",
    "text": "4.4 Counting bones\nWhen examining zooarchaeological remains, various methods can be employed to assess the abundance of a specific species at an archaeological site. Two commonly used measures for quantifying abundance are NISP (Number of Identified Specimens) and MNI (Minimum Number of Individuals). Both of them are not without shortcomings, which will be listed below.\n\n4.4.1 Number of Identified Specimens (NISP)\nThe Number of Identified Specimens (NISP) is the measure provided by most reports and is commonly used to estimate the relative frequency of zooarchaeological assemblages. It provides a count of the number of bone fragments identified to bone type and taxon (Lambacher et al., 2016; Orton, 2010). Although being so widely used, NISP is not without its limitations. One key challenge is its sensitivity to bone fragmentation, as it counts every encountered bone fragment, assigning equal weight to each fragment. However, animal bones exhibit distinct patterns of fragmentation, resulting in variations in fragment counts across species. Furthermore, different animals possess diverse types of hard tissue, leading to variations in the ease of identification for different bone elements (Klein and Cruz-Uribe, 1984; Reitz and Wing, 2008). Moreover, the preservation modes of remains play a significant role in the representation of species within the assemblage. Certain species may be better preserved than others due to factors such as differential decay rates or taphonomic biases. Additionally, consumption patterns and butchery practices can influence the preservation of specific bones. For instance, if an animal was butchered outside the settlement and only selected meat portions were brought in, certain bones may be underrepresented in the assemblage (Kent, 1993). Excavation methods, such as sieving and flotation, can introduce biases by selectively recovering smaller and more fragile remains like fish vertebrae, mollusc shells, or small mammal bones. Consequently, the application (or lack thereof) of sieving and flotation can introduce biases in the composition of the assemblage. In addition to these challenges, another issue that can inflate NISP counts is the inclusion of an entire skeleton of an animal. This can skew the relative frequency estimates, as a single individual contributes a disproportionate number of bones to the assemblage. To address this concern, another measure called the Minimum Number of Individuals (MNI) is often used (O’Connor, 2000, p. 56). Considering these factors, the NISP measure should be interpreted with caution, taking into account the complexities associated with bone fragmentation, preservation biases, consumption practices, and excavation methods.\n\n\n4.4.2 Minimum Number of Individuals (MNI)\nIntroduced by Theodore White (1953), the Minimum Number of Individuals (MNI) is a measure that estimates the minimum number of individuals needed to account for all the skeletal elements of a particular species found at a site. MNI takes into account the duplication of skeletal elements within a species, providing a more refined assessment of the faunal assemblage. Analysts determine MNI by examining the bones recovered and identifying the minimum number of individuals required to account for each bone element, considering factors such as articulation, overlap, and symmetry. Despite its utility, MNI has faced criticism from archaeologists, leading to the development of alternative approaches for its refinement. Sándor Bökönyi (1971, 1970) and Raymond Chaplin (1971) proposed incorporating additional factors like age, sex, and size to improve the accuracy of MNI calculations. In contrast, Donald Grayson (1981; Grayson and Dimbleby, 2014) highlighted the close relationship between MNI and NISP, emphasizing also how sample size affect the MNI estimation. A recognized limitation of MNI is its potential to overestimate the presence of rare taxa within an assemblage. This occurs because a single specimen of a rare taxon is given the same weight (i.e., a count of one) as multiple bones from a more common taxon (O’Connor, 2000, p. 60). Furthermore, Cornelis and Ina Plug and Plug (1990) cautioned against using MNI for further numerical analysis, including its conversion to relative frequencies, due to the mathematical incoherence of proportions derived from minimum values. While MNI has been subject to ongoing debate and critique among zooarchaeologists, with some stating that ‘critiquing MNI might be considered a growth industry among zooarchaeologists’ (Reitz and Wing, 2008, p. 206), this research primarily relies on NISP as the primary data measure. NISP is commonly reported in zooarchaeological studies, and its estimation methods tend to be less variable compared to MNI. While acknowledging the ongoing discussions surrounding MNI, this research opts to utilize NISP due to its widespread availability and more consistent application in reporting zooarchaeological data."

Legend: R = Roman, LR = Late Roman, EMA = Early Middle Ages, Ma = 11th c. onwards\n\n\n\nThe zooarchaeological data available for this project consists in 465 samples with faunal remains collected from a total of 228 sites dated between the 1st century BCE to the 11th century CE. The geographical and chronological distribution of the samples varies greatly, with some areas or chronological phases that are better represented in the database. The number of samples for each phase is detailed in Table 4.1, with samples that span more chronologies repeated. As explained in the methods section, some samples were dated between two chronologies, and the entry had to be repeated twice. Table 4.2 reports the total NISP count of the samples in the database, with and without the repetition. Table 4.3 shows instead the NISP count of samples divided by chronology. The group sizes in the dataset do not present significant class imbalance issues, particularly for the Roman, Late Roman, and Early Medieval phases. However, the 11th century phase has the smallest group size. This smaller size can be attributed to the fact that it represents the upper boundary of the research period under investigation. From what concerns spatial dispersion, there is no discernible geographical pattern in the distribution of zooarchaeological samples, although certain regions lack a substantial amount of data. Notably, central Italian regions such as Umbria and Marche are among those with limited representation in the dataset. In contrast, there is a concentration of samples specifically related to the Roman and Late Roman chronologies in the city of Rome and Ostia. The uneven distribution of samples in different regions and the concentrated presence of samples in Rome and Ostia are addressed separately in the results section. This section includes an analysis of the effect of Rome on the urban statistical models, examining how the abundance of samples from these locations may impact the overall findings and interpretations.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.1:  Number of zooarchaeological samples distributed by phase.

The distribution of samples demonstrates that plains and coasts exhibit a higher number of samples, with 181 and 119 samples, respectively. On the other hand, hills (n = 125) and mountains (n = 40) are slightly less represented in comparison. However, in addition to topographical models, the analysis also incorporates models that consider the elevations of the sites. This approach allows for a more detailed examination of the relationship between animals occurrence and site elevations. The results section provides a breakdown of the sites categorized by their elevation, providing further insights into the influence of elevation on the distribution of zooarchaeological remains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Topographical distribution of the zooarchaeological samples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBökönyi, S., 1970.

    "text": "5.1 Introduction\nDatabases are increasingly being used in archaeology to archive and collect data digitally. There are mainly two types of databases—relational and non-relational. A relational database is more appropriate for well-defined data structures which can be linked through a mutual attribute. It is built and maintained with Structured Query Language (SQL), which allows the user to interrogate the database through queries (Gattiglia, 2018). A SQL database consists of several tables containing information in columns (variables) and rows (entries). Each row is defined by an unique key. Examples of relational database management systems include—MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle Database. A non-relational database (NoSQL) is advantageous in the case of unstructured data, as data is archived as a single document rather than in a table. This structure allows much more flexibility, although NoSQL databases can be harder to use by non-specialists. Among the NoSQL database management systems, MongoDB is the most widely used."

    "text": "5.2 Databases in archaeology\nDatabases are used in archaeology primarily for two reasons—data management and data sharing. Most excavations are now working with databases, where the information concerning each stratigraphic unit and finds is recorded. Databases can also be linked and interact with Geographical Information Systems (GIS), that allow researchers to work with a spatial component. In many cases, this data remains private, even after the publication of the excavation results, although increasingly more teams are also making their data available to the public. The growing popularity of open data has also created the need for standardisation. Since the 1970s, researchers started working on thesauri (Figuera, 2018), dictionaries and guides for the correct archival of archaeological information (e.g. pottery classes, context types, chronologies, etc.). A shared system of naming practices is essential for sharing, integrating and analysing data. Recently, more standardised databases and repositories are being created and openly published:\n\nArchaeological Data Service (ADS). A non-profit organisation, based at the University of York. The website provides a large repository of downloadable archaeological data (mostly from the British isles) (Richards, 2021).\nARIADNEplus, a Horizon 2020 project funded by the European Commission aiming to build an integrated european archaeological data structure. Over 2 million datasets are part of this project, with the original data still managed by the original creators (Niccolucci, 2020).\n\nMost of the archaeological databases are based on SQL, as the visual relationships between different data structures are easier to understand."

    "text": "5.3 Creating an Environmental Archaeology database\nAn integrated database with environmental archaeology data is still missing in Italy. A first step towards botanical data digitalisation has been the BRAIN project (Botanical Records of Archaeobotany Italian Network), a census of the Italian excavations that reported archaeobotanical data (Mercuri et al., 2015). The website, although not providing raw data, has been useful to the bibliographical research for this project. For what concerns faunal remains, a database is missing, although a pilot project was started at the University of Siena by Boscato et al. (2007). The database was created using FileMaker Pro and was likely never published.\nFor the scope of this project, it was thus necessary to create a database that contained raw environmental data. The creation of a database for this research responded to the need of a systematic approach in storing environmental data in a common format and in a way that is convenient for querying, rather than merely archiving the information. The goal is to have data readily available for exploratory data analysis, in an automated process that does not require to adapt the query and manually wrangle data each time a new sample is added to the collection. This project uses MariaDB, a fast and stable fork of MySQL.\nThe database was structured with the creation of 21 tables. The table site_list is the core table, from which most of the other tables in the schema depend. The entries in the table are based on the chronology of a single sample. The chronology is defined both by the macroperiod1 and by the centuries, with two columns: startcentury and endcentury. If a context has been sampled more than once, there will be as many entries as many chronologies. If a context has been sampled both for seeds and bones, the sample IDs will be recorded on the same entry (if the chronologies match).\n\n\n\nContext\nSample #ID\n\n\n\n\nImola, villa Clelia, 6th c.\n15\n\n\nImola, villa Clelia, 10th-11th c.\n16\n\n\n\nSince the table is context based, each site has been provided with an unique ID, so that if the site has been sampled in different areas the database can be still queried using the site ID2. In addition to the reference to the samples table, the table site_list also contains references to child tables with information about: site type, geography, altitude, coordinates, and region. The samples are organized in three tables, depending on the type of remain that has to be recorded in the database:\n\nplant_remains\npollen_remains\nfaunal_remains\n\nEach entry in the samples tables contains information about chronology, sampling type and notes, reference to the publication, reference to the main site, and the raw data. The tables faunal_chrono_weights and plants_chrono_weights contain the automated calculation of the samples weights (refer to Section 6.2.2). The Figure 5.1 shows the schema with the complete list of tables in the database.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Schema of the database, with the table site_list at the core.\n\n\nThe data was stored in the database after a thorough bibliographical research of the excavated sites (with a chronology pertaining to the 1st millennium CE) where environmental analyses have been undertaken. As in most of the cases the material was retrieved from physical publications, not digitised, the process of data entry was manual and could not be automatised. A list of the publication types where data was retrieved from can be visualised in Figure 5.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Count of the publication types in the database."

    "text": "5.4 Database storing procedures\nThis sub chapter reports the breakthrough of all the tables stored inside the database. The database consists of several tables, most of which are linked together as typical for a relational database. Each table will be explained in detail, along with its fields, to allow future full reproducibility of the code.\n\n5.4.1 General tables\n\n5.4.1.1 Site features\nThe tables listed below were created to store information concerning site features including the site main attributes, geographical features, etc.\n\n5.4.1.1.1 Table: site_list\nThe sites/contexts details have been stored in the master table site_list. This is the main table that contains the main details for each context and it is linked to other tables, that will be introduced below. The fields included in the table are:\n\nsite_id: a unique id for the entry, incremental and auto generated.\nsite_code: an integer of the type int(11) referring to the site where the sample has been collected. If a site was sampled in more locations, the site will be referred by this value, but the site_id will be different. Note that for larger sites (e.g. Pompeii, Ostia, etc.) for convenience the code was attributed to each house.\nsite_name: text field of the type varchar(255), containing the name of the site. Given that the table is structured around the chronology of each sample, if a site was sampled in different locations or more chronologies are provided, the site name will include these pieces of information (see Section 5.3 for an example).\nsite_type: foreign key (linked to the table site_type), referring to the typology of the site where the sample has been collected. See Section 5.4.1.1.2 for details of the input values.\nsite_altitude: an integer value reporting the altitude (in meters) of the site.\ngeo_feature: foreign key (linked to the table geo_type), referring to the geography of the site where the sample has been collected.

The values that can be entered are: bot = Archaeobotanical remains, zoo = Zooarchaeological remains, poll = Pollen remains. If the codes are combined, more than one type of data is available for the same context and chronology.\nstartcentury: an integer indicating the first century covered by the sample. The value can be positive for CE centuries and negative for BCE centuries. For instance, if the author attributes the sample to the 2nd c. BCE to the 1st c. CE, the field will be filled with the value -2.\nendcentury: an integer indicating the last century covered by the sample. The value can be positive for CE centuries and negative for BCE centuries. For instance, if the author attributes the sample to the 2nd c. BCE to the 1st c. CE, the field will be filled with the value 1.\nbot: foreign key (linked to the table plant_remains). The input value is the uuid (unique id) of the archaeobotanical sample.\nzoo: foreign key (linked to the table faunal_remains). The input value is the uuid (unique id) of the zooarchaeological sample.\npoll: foreign key (linked to the table pollen_remains). The input value is the uuid (unique id) of the palynological sample.\n\n\n\n5.4.1.1.2 Table: site_type\nThe table site_type is linked to the site_list table and consists of two fields:\n\ntype_id: a unique id for the site type, incremental and auto generated.\ntype_name: text field describing the site type.\n\n\n\nTable 5.1: The table site_type. The values in the field type_id are inserted in the site_list table to indicate the site typology from which the sample has been collected.\n\n\ntype_id\ntype_name\n\n\n\n\n1\nRural\n\n\n2\nUrban\n\n\n3\nCastrum\n\n\n4\nCastle\n\n\n5\nNecropolis\n\n\n6\nRural site, villa\n\n\n7\nReligious\n\n\n8\nRural site, mansio\n\n\n9\nReligious, monastery\n\n\n10\nShipwreck\n\n\n11\nUrban, amphitheater\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.1.1.3 Table: regions\nThe table regions is linked to the site_list table and consists of two fields:\n\nregion_id: a unique id for the region, incremental and auto generated.\nregion_name: text field describing the region name.\n\n\n\nTable 5.2: The table regions. The values in the field region_id are inserted in the site_list table to indicate the current administrative region in which the site is located. Although outside the territorial boundaries of Italy, one of the sites in the database is located in the country of San Marino and the country has been added to this table.\n\n\nregion_id\nregion_name\n\n\n\n\n1\nAbruzzo\n\n\n2\nBasilicata\n\n\n3\nCalabria\n\n\n4\nCampania\n\n\n5\nEmilia-Romagna\n\n\n6\nFriuli-Venezia Giulia\n\n\n7\nLazio\n\n\n8\nLiguria\n\n\n9\nLombardia\n\n\n10\nMarche\n\n\n11\nMolise\n\n\n12\nPiemonte\n\n\n13\nPuglia\n\n\n14\nToscana\n\n\n15\nTrentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol\n\n\n16\nUmbria\n\n\n17\nValle d’Aosta\n\n\n18\nVeneto\n\n\n19\nSan Marino\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.1.1.4 Table: culture_list\nThe table culture_list is linked to the site_list table and consists of two fields:\n\nid_culture: a unique id for the culture type, incremental and auto generated.\nculture_type: text field describing the culture of the site.\n\n\n\nTable 5.3: The table culture_list. The values in the field id_culture are inserted in the site_list table to indicate the culture of the context.

It consists of 7 fields:\n\nuuid_refs: a unique id for the bibliographical element, incremental and auto generated.\nshort_ref: text field of the type varchar(255), which includes the short in-text reference formatted in Harvard style.\ncomplete_ref: text field of the type longtext, which includes the complete reference formatted in Harvard style.\nauthor: text field of the type varchar(255), with the name(s) of the author(s) of the publication. The last name is provided in full, while the first name is only indicated by the first letter. For instance, Jane Doe is formatted as “Doe, J.”.\nyear: numerical field of the type int(11), which provides the year of the publication.\nsite_code: numerical field of the type int(11), which provides the code of the site, from the field site_code in the table site_list.\npublication_type: foreign key, linked to the table bibliography_publ_type (See Table 5.7).\n\n\n\n5.4.1.2.2 Table: bibliography_publ_type\nThe table bibliography_publ_type is linked to the bibliography table and consists of two fields:\n\nuuid: a unique id for the publication type, incremental and auto generated.\nType: text field describing the publication type.\n\n\n\nTable 5.7: The table bibliography_publ_type. The values in the field uuid are inserted in the bibliography table (field publication_type) to assign a publication type to a publication.\n\n\nuuid\nType\n\n\n\n\n1\nBook\n\n\n2\nBook section\n\n\n3\nConference paper\n\n\n4\ne-mail\n\n\n5\nJournal article\n\n\n6\nWebpage\n\n\n7\nReport\n\n\n8\nPhD Thesis\n\n\n9\nMA Thesis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.1.3 Table: Periodization\nThe table Periodization consists of two fields:\n\nid: a unique id for the chronological period, incremental and auto generated.\nperiod: text field, of the type varchar(255) describing the publication type.\n\n\n\nTable 5.8: The table Periodization. The values in the field id are inserted in the tables plant_chronologies and faunal_chronologies (field sample_period) to assign a chronology to the sample.\n\n\nid\nPeriod\n\n\n\n\n1\nR\n\n\n2\nLR\n\n\n3\nEMA\n\n\n4\nMa\n\n\n\n\nFor further information concerning the division of the dataset into larger chronologies, see Section 6.2.1.\n\n\n\n5.4.2 Archaeobotany\n\n5.4.2.1 Macroremains\nThe process of data collection from edited publications (see Figure 5.2 for the publication types) did not present major problems in taxa comparability. The names of the plants were in fact matching across publications. However, in some cases authors could only identify the seeds’ species (e.g. Avena sp.), or it was not possible to properly identify the taxa (e.g. Cerealia und.). Specific taxa are indeed hard to identify without other elements of the plants; for this reason some taxa have been merged together in one column of the database. For instance, Triticum aestivum and Triticum durum are recorded together. Seed counts have been reported in the species column when an author reported a taxon rarely reported in other publications, rather than creating a new column for that taxon. For instance, Prunus armeniaca is reported in the column Prunus sp. In this case, the name of the identified taxon can be accessed through the extra_notes field.\n\n5.4.2.1.1 Table: plant_remains\nThe plant remains have been stored in the master table plant_remains. This is the main table that contains the absolute counts for each sample and it is linked to other tables, to locate the sample at site and chronological level. The fields included in the table are:\n\nuuid: a unique id for the sample, incremental and auto generated.\nsite_code: foreign key (linked to the table site_list) referring to the site where the sample has been collected. The input value is an integer of the type int(11).\nsite_type: foreign key (linked to the table site_type), referring to the typology of the site where the sample has been collected. See Section 5.4.1.1.2 for details of the input values.\ndata_valid_start: an integer indicating the first century covered by the sample. The value can be positive for CE centuries and negative for BCE centuries. For instance, if the author attributes the sample to the 2nd c. BCE to the 1st c. CE, the field will be filled with the value -2.\ndata_valid_end: an integer indicating the last century covered by the sample. The value can be positive for CE centuries and negative for BCE centuries. For instance, if the author attributes the sample to the 2nd c. BCE to the 1st c. CE, the field will be filled with the value 1.\nsampling_notes: a text field, of the type longtext, that can be filled with information concerning sampling methodologies, precise location of sampling (e.g. a kiln, a kitchen, a wastepit, etc.), a more precise chronological range (if the author provided a datation in years rather than centuries), preservation mode (e.g. charred, waterlogged, etc.) and further notes that might be useful.\nextra_notes: a multipurpose text field, of the type longtext, that can be filled with information concerning first interpretation of the layer or the data from which the sample has been collected. The field also reports if the excavation provided other archaeobotanical material not included in this database (e.g. anthracological analyses), or plants that are not part of this table (e.g. ruderals, weeds, etc.). Finally, the field also contains the breakdown of counts that have been summarised under one column. For instance, the field Cerealia at times summarises cereal types that are not recorded in separate fields; cereals as Triticum compactum are rarely mentioned in Italian archaeobotanical reports, and if reported on a separate field it would be underrepresented.\ndata_usable: boolean field. The value is 0 if the sample is not reliable (e.g. data too scarce, chronology too vague, etc.), but was recorded in the database as it might be useful for qualitative studies. If the value is 0 and the sample is hence not usable, the reason is reported in the field extra_notes. The value is 1 if the sample is reliable and it can be used quantitatively or for presence/absence analysis. Note that if the value is 0 the site will not appear in the map.\noverrepresented_data: a text field, of the type longtext, that can be filled with information regarding overrepresented taxa. This is a common occurrence in contexts as wine/olive processing areas or stocking deposits.\nreference_id: foreign key (linked to the table bibliography), referring to the bibliographical source that contained information about the sample. See Section 5.4.1.2 for details of the input values.\nvolume: an integer value reporting the volume (in litres) of the sample. Whenever more samples from the same location and with the same chronology have been reported by the author, they have been merged together and the volume represents the total of each sample. The volumes of the individual samples are reported in the field extra_notes.\nsampling_type: foreign key (linked to the table bot_sampling_type), referring to the sampling methodology used by the author. See Table 5.9 for details of the input values.\npres_charred: a binary field which takes the value of 1 if the macroremains in the sample are preserved by charring, 0 if the seeds were preserved any other way.\npres_mineralised: a binary field which takes the value of 1 if the macroremains in the sample are preserved by mineralisation, 0 if the seeds were preserved any other way.\npres_waterlogged: a binary field which takes the value of 1 if the macroremains in the sample are preserved by waterlogging, 0 if the seeds were preserved any other way.\nno_of_samples: an integer indicating the number of samples collected from the context recorded in the entry. As for the volume field, whenever more samples from the same location and with the same chronology have been reported by the author, they have been merged together.\nFields for the absolute counts of the taxa: Triticum aestivum/durum, Triticum dicoccum, Triticum monococcum, Avena sp, Hordeum vulgare, Panicum milliaceum, Secale cereale, Setaria italica, Sorghum bicolor, Cerealia ind, Leguminosae, Lens culinaris, Pisum sativum,Vicia faba, Vicia sativa, Vicia sp, Lathyrus cicera/sativus, Cicer aretinum, Cornus mas, Corylus avellana, Ficus carica, Fragaria vesca, Juglans regia, Castanea sativa, Malus domestica, Olea europaea L, Prunus cerasus, Prunus avium, Prunus sp, Prunus persica, Prunus domestica, Prunus spinosa, Rubus fruticosus, Pyrus communis, Sambucus nigra, Cucumis melo, Vitis vinifera, Linum usatissimus, Sorbus sp. The fields are of the type int(11) and are filled with the absolute count copied from the author’s report.\n\n\n\n5.4.2.1.2 Table: bot_sampling_type\nThe table bot_sampling_type is linked to the plant_remains table and consists of two fields:\n\nsampl_id: a unique id for the sampling typology, incremental and auto generated.\nsampl_type: text field describing the sampling methods. Other sampling types that are commonly used in archaeobotany (e.g. total sampling, probabilistic sampling, etc.) are not part of this table as no excavation reported using them.\n\n\n\nTable 5.9: The table bot_sampling_type and its values. The values in the field sampl_id are inserted in the plant_remains table to indicate the sampling method used for the collection of the recorded sample (whether this was reported by the author).\n\n\nsampl_id\nsampl_type\n\n\n\n\n1\nvisual sampling\n\n\n2\nvs + specified quantity\n\n\n3\nspecified quantity\n\n\n4\nnot specified\n\n\n5\nspecified variable quantity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.2.1.3 Table: plants_chronologies\nThe table plants_chronologies consists of two fields:\n\nsample_id: foreign key (linked to the table plant_remains), where the sample_id is the field uuid.\nsample_period: foreign key (linked to the table Periodization), where the sample_period is the field id.\n\nInformation concerning the way the chronology is attributed to the sample can be found in the methodology chapter (Section 6.2.1).\n\n\n5.4.2.1.4 Table: plants_chrono_weights\nThe table plants_chrono_weights consists of two fields:\n\nuuid: a foreign key connected to the table plant_remains, where the uuid is the uuid of the sample.\nweight: a numerical field decimal(5,4) that indicates the weight (reliability) of the sample.\n\nInformation concerning the way the weight is calculated can be found in the methodology chapter.\n\n\n\n\n5.4.3 Zooarchaeology\nThe process of data collection from edited publications did not present major issues in species comparability. In most cases, animal names were matching across publications. Whenever this was not the case, the scientific name of the species was provided, which was helpful in case of uncertainties (e.g. ‘Hen’ vs ‘Chicken’). Given the size of this project, not every species has been recorded in the database. Species that were not useful to the reconstruction of agricultural practices (for instance, tortoises) have been recorded in the field extra_notes of the table faunal_remains. Other species were merged together into a single column. This is the case of Mollusca. When authors were not certain about the classification of certain bones to the species level, they have been reported at the genus or family level. The most common occurrence is for sheep and goats, mostly reported under the Caprinae family, or for donkeys and horses, reported under the Equus sp.\n\n5.4.3.1 Table: faunal_remains\nThe animal remains have been recorded in the master table faunal_remains. This is the main table that contains the NISP counts from each sample and it is linked to other tables, to locate the sample at site and chronological level. The fields included in the table are:\n\nuuid: a unique id for the sample, incremental and auto generated.\nsite_code: foreign key (linked to the table site_list) referring to the site where the sample has been collected. The input value is an integer of the type int(11).\nsite_type: foreign key (linked to the table site_type), referring to the typology of the site where the sample has been collected. See Section 5.4.1.1.2 for details of the input values.\ndata_valid_start: an integer indicating the first century covered by the sample. The value can be positive for CE centuries and negative for BCE centuries. For instance, if the author attributes the sample to the 2nd c. BCE to the 1st c. CE, the field will be filled with the value -2.\ndata_valid_end: an integer indicating the last century covered by the sample. The value can be positive for CE centuries and negative for BCE centuries. For instance, if the author attributes the sample to the 2nd c. BCE to the 1st c. CE, the field will be filled with the value 1.\nsampling_notes: a text field, of the type longtext, that can be filled with information concerning sampling methodologies, precise location of sampling (e.g. a kiln, a kitchen, a wastepit, etc.), a more precise chronological range (if the author provided a datation in years rather than centuries), and further notes that might be useful.\nextra_notes: a multipurpose text field, of the type longtext, that can be filled with information concerning first interpretation of the layer or the data from which the sample has been collected. The field also reports if the excavation provided other information that are not included in this database, namely—age, sex, MNI counts, etc. Finally, the field also contains the breakdown of counts that have been summarised under one column. For instance, the field Mollusca or ‘Unsp. birds’; some types of birds are rarely mentioned in other publications, and if reported on a separate field they would be underrepresented.\ndata_usable: boolean field. The value is 0 if the sample is not reliable (e.g. data too scarce, chronology too vague, etc.), but was recorded in the database as it might be useful for qualitative studies. If the value is 0 and the sample is hence not usable, the reason is reported in the field extra_notes. The value is 1 if the sample is reliable and it can be used quantitatively. Note that if the value is 0 the site will not appear in the map.\nreference_id: foreign key (linked to the table bibliography), referring to the bibliographical source that contained information about the sample. See Section 5.4.1.2 for details of the input values.\nMNI_provided: text field of the type varchar(255). The value is No if the publication did not report MNI (minimum number of individuals) counts and Yes if MNI was provided.\ndata_type: foreign key (linked to the table zoo_data_type) used to record which type of data the authors reported in the publication. See Table 5.10 for details of the input values.\ntot_id: an integer (of the type int(11)) that reports the number of identified bones in the sample.\ntot_unid: an integer (of the type int(11)) that reports the number of unidentified bones in the sample.\nFields for the NISP values of the species, reported with the scientific name: Sus scrofa domesticus, Bos taurus, Ovis aries, Capra hircus, Ovis/Capra, Canis familiaris, Equus caballus, Equus asinus, Equidae, Sus scrofa ferus, Cervus elaphus, Dama Dama L, Capreolus c, Cervidae, Lepus, Ursus actor, Glis Glis, Vulpes vulpes L, Unsp birds, Gallus g, Anser a, Unsp fish, Esox lucius, Salmo trutta, Salvelinus umbla, Tinca Tinca, Mollusca. The fields are of the type int(11) and are filled with the NISP count copied from the author’s report.\n\n\n\n5.4.3.2 Table: zoo_data_type\nThe table zoo_data_type consists of two fields:\n\nuuid: a unique id for the entry, incremental and auto generated.\ntype: text field, of the type varchar(255) describing the data type reported in the publication.\n\n\n\nTable 5.10: The table zoo_data_type.

    "text": "6.2 Data collection\nIn this project, legacy or published data from various sources, including excavation reports, excavation monographs, and journal articles, were utilized. The complete list of these sources can be found in the sites bibliography, and a graphical representation indicating the primary data sources is provided in Chapter 5. For the archaeobotanical data, Mercuri et al. (2015) and Grasso and Fiorentino (2009) served as significant references for the bibliography and served as valuable starting points. The data was subsequently organized and stored in a relational database, as detailed in Chapter 5. In selecting the data for collection, specific criteria were applied. Reports had to provide a chronology, expressed in terms of centuries, to ensure accuracy and avoid ambiguous descriptive phases such as “Late Antiquity” or “Roman” without accompanying dating information. This approach minimizes the risk of misinterpretation when analysing the data. Regarding the selection of sites to store in the database, all sites were recorded, maintaining a comprehensive record. However, for certain analyses, such as PERMANOVA and nMDS, specific samples were excluded if they only contained one sporadic seed. This exclusion was necessary to ensure robust statistical analyses and meaningful results. Samples were stored in the database if they provided at least a site-level location. For plant and animal taxa, clear and unambiguous taxonomic indications were required for inclusion in the database. For instance, plants belonging to the Triticum group that could not be further identified to a species level were categorized as ‘Unsp. Cereals’. Similarly, animal bones that were either unidentified or only identified in terms of size were stored as ‘unidentified’ to avoid potential confusion with other taxa. By implementing these criteria and guidelines for data selection and storage, the project aims to maintain data integrity, enhance analytical rigour, and ensure clarity in the interpretation of the results.\n\nPut periodization here?\nIntroduce here the ‘site types’ problem?\nPut chronological fuzziness here?\nPut somewhere the division in sub-regions, maybe cite also Palmisano https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10963-021-09159-3 and https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10963-021-09158-4\n\n\n6.2.1 Periodization\nSome of the statistics performed on the dataset have been based on sample periodization, from the Roman age to the Medieval age. The chronologies have been defined as follows:\n\n[R] Roman: from the 1st century BCE to the 2nd century CE.\n[LR] Late Roman: from the 3rd to the 5th century CE.\n[EMA] Early Middle Ages: from the 6th to the 10th century CE.\n[Ma] Middle Ages: from the 11th century CE onwards.\n\nIn the database, the tables faunal_chronologies and plants_chronologies connect each bioarchaeological sample to another table with the identification numbers for the periods (e.g. Sample 1 = ID 1). If a sample has a chronology ranging between two periods, two separate entries will be recorded on the database (e.g. Sample 1 – 2nd to 3rd c. CE = Periods: Roman, Late Roman) with the result of the sample being repeated in both periods.\n\n\n\nPeriodization schema.\n\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Chronological fuzziness\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nRemove?\n\n\nOne of the methodological issues affecting this project is that of chronological fuzziness. Dating plant and animal remains using radiocarbon is very rare, at least in the samples recorded in the database. Most of these samples are dated using ceramics, and chronologies can range between one century or several. Taking this into account, I weighted each sample as follows: \\[ W=\\frac{1}{(C_{end}-C_{start}+1)} \\] Where:\n\n\\(C\\_{end}\\) is the terminus ante quem.\n\\(C\\_{start}\\) is the terminus post quem.\n1 has been summed to the denominator to avoid 0 values.\n\nThe imported tables already contain a column of weights, as this operation has been performed on the database prior the export. A diachronic table of means for both datasets has been generated using the functions:\n\nzooarch_tables (custom)\nBot_mean_table (custom)\nBot_mean_fun (custom)\nweightedMedian (from the package matrixStats)\n\nThe weight can be used for weighted means and medians, with samples with larger chronologies (hence less precise/fuzzy) weighting less. This method provides each sample with a weight proportional to the length of its chronology so that lower weight values have a smaller impact on the computations.\n\n\n6.2.3 Site types\nWrite that for this project, decisions were made about how to classify archaeological sites in order to gather statistical data and store them in a database. Some sites, such as castra, are relatively easy to identify and categorize. However, there can be uncertainty when it comes to classifying sites as urban or rural, as these terms can have different meanings in the context of archaeology. In order to make these categorizations, it is important to consider the specific context and characteristics of each site, as well as the definitions and criteria being used to classify them.\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2212054820300515\nsee also Bowes, p. 11 for the traditional terms in Italian archaeology (farm, villa, etc)"

Say why I used it.\n\n\nStatistical computing, often referred to as computational statistics, is a branch of statistics that uses computational approaches to solving statistical problems. Traditionally, the term statistical computing places more emphasis on numerical methods, while computational statistics refer to topics such as resampling methods, exploratory data analysis, neural networks, etc. (Rizzo, 2019). Specifically, computational statistics deals with methods “unthinkable before the computer age” (Lauro, 1996). In archaeology, one widely used programming language for statistical computing is R, which has the advantage of relying on its strong academic community. The community actively contributes to the development of new packages, expanding the functionality and versatility of R for statistical computing. Researchers often choose R for statistical computing in archaeology due to its comprehensive statistical capabilities, flexibility, and the ability to reproduce and share analyses. The syntax and structure of R are specifically designed to facilitate data analysis and statistical modeling, allowing researchers to perform complex analyses efficiently. Additionally, R provides powerful data visualization tools, enabling researchers to create visually appealing and informative graphics to communicate their findings.\n\n6.3.1 The R programming language\nR, as described on the R-Project FAQs is a “system for statistical computation and graphics. It consists of a language plus a run-time environment with graphics, a debugger, access to certain system functions, and the ability to run programs stored in script files”. Increasingly popular for data scientists, R is based on S and provides its own IDE (the R GUI), although RStudio1 is the most popular IDE for computing the R language. For this project, RStudio was the standard IDE.\n\n6.3.1.1 R Packages\nIn addition to base R, several packages enhance its performances and offer more tools to users. The packages are distributed by the official CRAN repository, which counts more than 19,533 packages2.\n\n6.3.1.1.1 tidyverse\nThe tidyverse ecosystem (Wickham et al., 2019) is a core set of packages for R, maintained by Hadley Wickham for importing, tidying, transforming and visualising data which includes packages such as—ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, stringr, tibble, forcats, purr, readr.\n\n\n6.3.1.1.2 ggplot2\nggplot2 is the most common data visualisation package for R, included in the tidyverse environment. The package substitutes the R base graphics and allows visualisation of single and multiple components (Wickham, 2016).\n\n\n6.3.1.1.3 knitr\nThe knitr engine enables the integration of R with HTML, Markdown and LaTeX. The package allows reproducible research (Xie, 2021) and was used for generating dynamic reports and documentation for this thesis.\n\n\n6.3.1.1.4 vegan\nThe vegan package (Oksanen et al., 2022) is designed for ordination methods, diversity analysis and multivariate analysis in ecology.\n\n\n6.3.1.1.5 rethinking\nThe rethinking package (McElreath, 2023) provides tools and resources for statistical modeling and data analysis in a Bayesian framework. Developed by Richard McElreath, it is specifically designed to support the concepts and techniques described in his book “Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan” (McElreath, 2016).\n\n\n\n\n6.3.2 Archaeobotanical quantifications\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection in progress\n\n\n\nIssues: problems with the data and general problems in sampling\nBIASES: Talk about the biases and dataset problems here or do it in the Materials chapter?\nWrite that Quantifications on the archaeobotanical dataset were affected by several biases. Write that certain species have been identified as sp. or that others are merged (triticum a/d) because hard to tell apart\n\n\n\n6.3.2.1 Ubiquity\nUbiquity, or presence analysis, is a popular approach in archaeobotanical quantitative analysis. The method is straightforward—the number of sites/contexts where a plant is present is divided by the total number of sites/contexts under examination. If, for instance, an olive pit is present in 3 sites out of 10, the ubiquity for the olive will be 30%. The formula for the calculation is at follows:\n\\[\nU_x = (\\frac{N_p}{N_{tot}}) \\cdot 100\n\\] where \\(N_p\\) is the number of presences, and \\(N_{tot}\\) is the total number of contexts. The result can be multiplied by 100 to obtain a score in %.\nThis approach has both advantages and drawbacks. Presence analysis minimizes the impact of outliers (overrepresented plant species) on calculations (Wright, 2010, pp. 51–52), but the relative importance of a plant in a particular context is lost. It is also important to keep in mind that taxa richness is influenced by factors including sample size, deposition and preservation modes, and sampling strategies (e.g. sieving methodologies) (Pearsall, 2015, pp. 161–2).\n\nRemind the reader about the sample size problem. Somewhere (maybe Pearsall 2005 chapter ubiquity) there was a graph that showed how ubiquity is influenced by sample size\nWrite about the problems of this dataset that led to the choice of ubiquity as parameter\n\nUbiquity is the best option to immediately read the Italian peninsular botanical dataset. The variability in the seeds/fruits samples is too high, with different species being outliers in different sites. A likely reason for this is probably the poor sampling quality, usually occurring after an agglomerate of seeds is found during excavation. Normally, agglomerates are found in specific storage places or processing areas (e.g. wine/olive processing quarters), skewing the distribution of the curve. Ubiquity overcomes this issue, as it provides a score based on the percentage of presences of a plant species in the samples considered.\nIn addition to the general calculation of the diachronic ubiquity in the entire peninsula, it is also important to look for regional differences in the archaeobotanical dataset. To do so, I created an R function to subset data related to Northern, Central and Southern Italian regions. For a clearer reading of the plot, I divided the plants into–Cereals, Pulses and Fruits/Nuts. The results are in Chapter 7.\n\n\n6.3.2.2 Diversity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n\nIntroduce the concept of diversity. Why is it useful?\n\n\nSpecies richness (\\(S\\)) is the number of species found within a community or ecosystem. The boundaries of the region are defined by the researcher. While ecologists use sampling or census to obtain the richness value, archaeobotanists can only rely on sampling, counting the presence of species in the area under investigation (Moore, 2013). Species diversity is a measurement of species richness combined with species evenness, meaning it takes into account not only how many species are present but also how evenly distributed the numbers of each species are.\nThere are different ways to calculate species diversity…\nShannon-W"

    "text": "6.4 Multivariate statistics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection in progress\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis research uses multivariate analysis to explore possible relationships within the sets of environmental data under investigation. Univariate analyses can be easily plotted and visualized with bar charts, histograms and density curves. A scatterplot (or scattergram) shows the relationship between two variables by plotting their values on the axes of a diagram using Cartesian coordinates. This relationship can also be mathematically measured by calculating a distance between two points in the graph. However, the relationship between more than two variables is much harder to read on a scatterplot, as it would require as many axes as the number of variables. If our analysis is exploratory, we might not know yet where to look for correlations. A possible solution is analysing each combination of two variables in the dataset and measure their correlation. This would require too much computation time if the dataset had a large number of variables, that is to say if we are dealing with big data. In addition, we would only gather information about the relationship between two variables, when there might be another factor influencing a trend or phenomenon. Multivariate statistics has a wide range of applications, including grouping and multidimensional scaling, as well as in machine learning and predictive analysis (Fletcher and Lock, 2005). In this research, multivariate methods have been applied both to the botanical and faunal datasets, mainly with the objective of (i) testing hypotheses between multiple variables and (ii) reducing the dimensionality of data to—assess which variables are the main drivers of change in the datasets and examine relationships between these variables.\n\n6.4.1 Statistical hypothesis testing\nExplain what is hypothesis testing\n\n6.4.1.1 PERMANOVA\nPermutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) is a non-parametric multivariate statistical test used to compare group of objects. By using measure space, the null hypothesis that the centroids and dispersion of groups are identical is tested. The null hypothesis is rejected if either the centroid or the spread of the objects differs between the groups. A prior calculation of the distance between any two objects included in the experiment is used to determine whether the test is valid or not. (Anderson, 2017).\n\n\n\n6.4.2 Dimensionality reduction and ordination\nDimensionality reduction techniques transform high-dimension datasets into a low-dimension ordination space, with the intention of maintaining the geometry and data structure as close as possible to the original dataset. The dimension of a dataset is given by the number of variables (i.e. the columns in the table). As anticipated in Section 6.4, as each variable is graphically represented by an axis, it would be virtually impossible to represent more than three axes in a graph. Ordination allows to reduce data dimensionality to usually one to three (at most) dimensions. Moreover, focusing on a reduced number of dimensions reduces the amount of “noise” that can mislead the interpretation (Gauch, 1982). The points generated through ordination techniques (the objects in our dataset) can eventually be plotted in a scatterplot. In most of the ordination methods, points plotting closer together in graph are more similar, whereas points far apart from each other are more dissimilar (Shennan, 1997, p. 197). For instance, one could perform an ordination on a group of burials in a cemetery where each point represents a single burial assemblage. After the ordination it is also possible to group the new reduced set of variables, to observe differences between groups and facilitate the interpretation. In the previous example, a group might be represented by burials of the same ethnic group, status, etc.\nMany of the ordination techniques described in this chapter developed in fields outside archaeology, and are thus borrowed from disciplines as community ecology. Ecologists regularly apply ordination methods for the study of environmental gradients, so that the term “gradient analysis” is often used interchangeably with “ordination”. An environmental gradient refers to variations in site characteristics (e.g. time, elevation, temperature, vegetation, etc.), which in turn can affect biotic factors (e.g. species abundance, diversity, etc.) (Grebner et al., 2013). The purpose of ordination is then to identify the cause of ecological processes in the dataset. Generally, it is possible to apply ordination on datasets in which the variables have a cause-and-effect (e.g. climate vs. plant species) or mutual influences on each other. There are two main types of ordination, or gradient analysis, techniques (see Table 6.1): direct (constrained) or indirect (unconstrained). The objective of indirect (unconstrained) gradient analysis is to identify patterns between samples of ‘dependent variables’ (e.g. which sites are more similar according to their species composition). Conversely, direct gradient (or constrained) analysis includes more information (or tables) in a single analysis—the dependent variables are now constrained to be a function of other sets of ‘independent variables’ (usually environmental proxies). In short, a constrained analysis uses both datasets to find the best possible mathematical relationship between the dependent and independent variables. In this sense, direct gradient analysis can be considered as an extension of unconstrained analysis (Syms, 2008). The choice between using constrained or unconstrained methods for ordination strictly depends on the research questions and on the researcher’s dataset.\n\n\nTable 6.1: Ordination methods used in gradient analysis.

The analysis of eigenvalues and eigenvectors will not be described in detail in this chapter, and the meaning of the terms will be only briefly explained in the text. However, some information must be given for the eigenanalysis-based ordination methods:\n\nThe methods are performed on a square symmetric matrix (for instance a correlation matrix);\nThe order of the variables is not important for the result;\nAxes are ranked according to their eigenvalues (i.e. the first axis has the largest eigenvalue, the second the second-largest, etc.)\nEigenvalues have mathematical meaning that is important for the interpretation of our data.\n\n\n\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) is an useful tool to identify possible patterns or sub-groups in data. The input variables in the dataset must be numerical (or at least dichotomous). If used for machine learning, PCA is in fact an unsupervised method, meaning that the data points will be unlabelled after the transformation. As for other dimensionality reduction methods, the algorithm tries to preserve the global structure of data by finding a space in which dimensions can be reduced without losing much information. In other words, PCA optimizes the loss of variance. The first step in PCA is creating a correlation matrix or covariance matrix, to extract the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The decision between correlation or covariance matrix depends on our data and on our research questions. Correlation matrices are helpful if our variables have different units (e.g. lenght, volume, etc.). Covariance matrices can be used if the variables have the same unit and comparable variances. The latter is an important factor to consider before choosing covariance matrices, as the biggest variances will overshadow the others (Carlson, 2017, p. 267). For PCA, the eigenvalues are the variances of the principal components (so that the first component has the largest eigenvalue) and the eigenvectors are the principal component loadings (the score for each variable in the new dimensional space). After extracting the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, the user must decide how many components he will use. The components (defined as the sum in % of the eigenvalues) are the axes in our new dimensional space. Most of the times, the first two components are enough to explain the variance in our dataset. For instance, if the first two axes explain 80% and 12% of the variance, it is acceptable to use a 2D graph—the graphical representation of the two axes will explain 92% of the variance. It is possible to choose the appropriate number of components by using a scree plot, which shows the amount of variance for each component. Scree plots are an important of PCA, because they allow us to see how many components have a significant variance (eigenvalue). A significant variance must be greater than 1. If more than 2 or 3 components have a variance greater than 1, PCA might not be the best method for reducing our set of data. The example in Figure 6.1 shows that PCA in this case is an appropriate method, as only the first two components have variances greater than 1. Therefore we can discard the other components as they are of little significance.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Example of a scree plot showing that only the first two components have a variance greater than 1. Figure after Carlson (2017, p. 271)\n\n\nMost of the statistical packages offer an automatic rotation of the axes for an easier interpretation of the results, which is more important if the data has been standardised prior to the calculations.\n\n6.4.2.1.1 Interpreting a PCA\nPCA are often visualised through biplots, which shows at the same time the scores of the observations (rows) and the loadings of the variables (columns). Generally, the x-axis of the plot represents the first component, and the y-axis the second component. Making sense of the plotted observations is straightforward—points that are closer together are more similar and they can create clusters. It is important to remember that first component of the PCA lays on the x-axis, so differences in clusters on the first component (i.e. the horizontal distance) is actually larger than differences in clusters on the second component (i.e. the vertical distance). Interpreting the variable loadings can be more difficult. The variables are represented by arrows, implying that the variable increases in the direction of the arrow and decreases in the opposite direction. The direction of the arrow is given by the loadings of the first component—if the loadings are negative the arrows will point to the left. If the signs of the loadings are flipped the result will be the same but the arrows will point towards opposite directions. The arrows show how strongly each variable influences a principal component, with longer arrows being the best described in the dimension. The angle between the arrows also indicate extra information useful for the interpretation:\n\nIf two arrows form a small angle, the two variables are positively correlated.\nIf two arrows form a large diverging angle, the two variables are negatively correlated.\nIf two arrows form an angle close to 90°, there might be no correlation at all.\n\nFigure 6.2 shows an example of a PCA biplot. All the arrows (variables) point to the same direction, but we can interpret their correlations using the angles as described above. For example, B1 and B2 are not correlated, as they form an angle of 90°. On the contrary, the variables B and L are positively correlated, as they form a very small angle.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: PCA Biplot, after Carlson (2017, p. 274)\n\n\n\n\n\n6.4.2.2 CA\nCorrespondence analysis (CA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that can be applied to contingency tables. Contingency tables (or crosstabs) are two-way tables used to display frequency data formed by two categorical variables. In some ways, correspondence analysis is similar to PCA, being an indirect gradient analysis3 used to summarize categorical variables. As opposed to maximising the variance, CA maximises the degree of correspondence between rows and columns (i.e. observations and variables). The distance matrix used to perform the analysis is obtained from the chi-square distance between the rows and columns profiles. This is a modification of the chi-square statistic for hypothesis testing (Tallarida and Murray, 1987). An in-depth technical and methodological breakdown of correspondence analysis is beyond the scope of this text, and readers can refer to Greenacre (2021). As in PCA, the analysis generates—eigenvalues, row coordinates (scores), and column coordinates (loadings). An important distinction must be made with PCA with regard to eigenvalues. In PCA, eigenvalues refer to the ‘variation explained’. Conversely, in CA eigenvalues represent the inertia, the correlation coefficient between rows and columns (i.e. how well does the row correspond to the column?).\nCorrespondence analysis is appropriate for exploring non-negative data (e.g. relative abundance, counts, presence/absence) in a contingency table, and examining the relationships between cells in a row, in a column, and their interrelationship (Baxter, 2015, p. 101). On a practical level, CA can be used to compare assemblages from different sites, to answer questions such as “which sites do certain finds correspond to?” or “which sites are more similar according to their assemblages?”. This technique is extremely useful for archaeologists, even though its reception by the archaeological community has been slow. CA has been used by archaeologists since the mid-70s in France, although the technique was only introduced to the English-speaking audience in the 80s with a paper by Bølviken et al. (1982), and became more popular in the 90s (Baxter, 2015; Baxter and Cool, 2010). One of the biggest drawbacks of CA is its sensitivity to outliers (values that are either much bigger or much smaller when compared to the others in the table). Some of the samples used in this project suffer from this problem, and the causes of outliers will be discussed in more detail later in this text4. The algorithm tends to place larger abundances towards the centre of the diagonal, and small or zero values away from the diagonal—it is indeed a bad idea to use CA with tables containing outliers. Outliers represent a major problem in CA, as their presence will determine the scale of the biplot, thus clustering the other points closer together, and perhaps obscuring some of the patterns we are interested in finding. In this eventuality, these points might be poorly ordinated. A possible way to overcome this issue would be to check whether the other dimensions are more appropriate for the representation, even though the sensible thing to do would be to remove these outliers from the original contingency table and to study them separately. Practical examples of outliers are rare species, for instance rows with a few non-zero values. Rare species should not be studied with CA, unless the table only contains rare species, with comparable values. As Baxter and Cool (2010, p. 225) note, we should not regard this omission as “subjective and unjustified data manipulation”—there are other ways to visualise outliers along with the rest of our data, for instance boxplots.\nIn R, common implementations of correspondence analysis are included in the packages MASS, FactoMineR and vegan. CA has been used several times in this research using the function cca() from the vegan package, which was applied to the presence/absence archaeobotanical dataset (**add where else**5). The function cca() performs a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), but it can also be used for correspondence analysis.\n\n6.4.2.2.1 Interpreting a CA\nCorrespondence analyses are also visualised through biplots. As in PCA, the horizontal axis represents most of the variance, and the vertical axis is the second most representative dimension. A classic example for understanding and interpreting CA comes from a survey on the smoking habits of 193 employees in a fictitious company (Table 6.2). The staff members are categorised according to their position in the company (rows) and smoking habits (columns).\n\n\nTable 6.2: Smoking habits of staff groups, example after Greenacre (1984).\n\n\nStaff\nNone\nLight\nMedium\nHeavy\n\n\n\n\nSenior Manager (SM)\n4\n2\n3\n2\n\n\nJunior Manager (JM)\n4\n3\n7\n4\n\n\nSenior Employee (SE)\n25\n10\n12\n4\n\n\nJunior Employee (JE)\n18\n24\n33\n13\n\n\nSecretaries (SC)\n10\n6\n7\n2\n\n\n\n\nThe technical details of how the algorithm computes scores for this dataset are described in Greenacre (2021, pp. 65–72). After computing the CA, it is possible to visualise the biplot. In Figure 6.3, the x-axis explains 87.8% of the variance, and the y-axis 11.8%. Together, they explain 99.6% of the total variance in the dataset, an optimal representation of the dataset. Much of the variance is explained by the first component (x-axis), and the horizontal distance between points is thus much more important than the vertical distance (on the y-axis).\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: Correspondence analysis performed on Table 6.2, image after Greenacre (2021, p. 67).\n\n\nA scree plot can be helpful to evaluate the number of dimensions to choose, representing eigenvalues (or variances) from the largest to the smallest. The number of dimensions should be chosen by looking at where the scree plot starts to bend and the eigenvalues start to become small. An example of a scree plot has already been provided in Figure 6.1. The biplot contains points both for rows and columns. As the distances between points are chi-squared distances, for the interpretation of the results row points closer together are more similar, and the same logic applies to column points. However, one should be careful when interpreting distances between row and column points. The way to interpret their correlation is similar to the PCA:\n\nIf angle formed by the lines connecting the row and column labels to the origin is small, the association is strong.\nIf the angle is 90°, there is no association.\nIf the angle is near 180°, the association is negative.\n\nIn addition to what already mentioned, it is important to remember that points away from the origin and the edges are the most informative, as they might represent a better ordination.\nReturning to the interpretation of the CA in Figure 6.3, from the example concerning the smoking habits of the staff members in a company, it is easy to see how the smoking categories (on the left) are separated from the non-smokers (on the right). The groups that display the biggest separation are Junior Employee-Junior Manager, against Senior Employee. Secretaries are closer to Senior Employees. On the vertical axis, it is possible to see how Junior Employees are relatively more light smokers when compared to Junior Managers.\n\n\n\n6.4.2.3 nMDS\nMultidimensional scaling (MDS) is a technique to visualise the level of similarity of individual observations (e.g. sites/cases) in a dataset. MDS works with matrices containing Euclidean distances between each pair of observations. Conversely, non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) is a rank-based approach that finds both:\n\nA non-parametric monotonic relationship between the items in the dissimilarity matrix and the Euclidean distances.\nThe location of items in the low-dimensional space.\n\nThe goal of nMDS is to represent the pairwise dissimilarity between items in the matrix as closely as possible. For this reason, it is considered as a good technique for multivariate data visualisation. nMDS can be used on quantitative, qualitative and mixed data. The R function metaMDS from the package vegan allows users to select the distance metric most appropriate to their data (e.g. Bray-Curtis, Jaccard, etc.). As nMDS is an iterative approach, meaning that the the computations are run until the best solution is found, it can be quite computationally demanding for larger datasets. Although the nMDS algorithm tries to minimize the ordination stress, it is a good practice to compute the ordination stress value to judge the reliability of the solution found (goodness-of-fit). Ordination stress indicates how much distorted are the fitted data when compared to the original observed samples. Stress values can also be visualised with the function stressplot() (vegan package), which produces a Shepard stressplot (Figure 6.4).\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: A Shepard plot, from R Studio Pubs.\n\n\nThe Shepard plot displays the ordination distance against the observed distance. Ideally, the higher the points should fall on a monotonic line, where an increased observed distance is related to an increased ordination distance. Moreover, the higher the number of dimensions, the lower the stress value. If interested in choosing the appropriate number of dimensions, it is possible to use a scree plot which shows the number of dimensions against the stress level. Generally, it is possible to interpret stress values following these guidelines (Dexter et al., 2018):\n\n\nTable 6.3: Ordination stress for the interpretation of nMDS\n\n\nInterpretation\nStress level\n\n\n\n\nExcellent\n< 0.05\n\n\nGood\n< 0.1\n\n\nUsable (but caution is required)\n> 0.2\n\n\nRandom\n> 0.3\n\n\n\n\nIf the solution has produced a good stress level for the number of dimensions required, it is possible to plot the nMDS and interpret the results. Points that plot closer together are more similar, while points that are distant one to each other are more different. The nMDS plot can also be useful in recognizing groups (points grouping together and plotting further from other points). An example is provided in Figure 6.5.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.5: A nMDS plot with clusters, from R Studio Pubs.\n\n\nIn this project, nMDS has been applied to the Roman and early Medieval cereal datasets, with the scope of dimensionality reduction. The dataset has been reduced to one dimension to show a greater degree of separation between Northern and Southern Italy in the early Middle Ages. The entire process of data preparation and processing is described in WRITE WHERE."

It is possible however to compare plants’ ubiquity values in different areas of the peninsula. The R function Ubiquity_macroreg_chrono() (Section 2.3) was created to subset data from Northern, Central and Southern Italian regions, using modern boundaries. Archaeobotanical data from Italy is scarce, and subsetting the dataset required a larger chronological division to have enough sites for a valid statistical interpretation of the results. For this reason, the ubiquity values are presented using the variable Chronology rather than subsetting the individual centuries. For a clearer reading of the plot, the taxa have been divided into–Cereals, Pulses and Fruits/Nuts. Some taxa have been omitted from the plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.1.1 Cereals\nIt is interesting to notice how in the Roman age, cereals are similarly ubiquitous in Southern and Northern Italy, although there are some exceptions (i.e. einkorn, rye, oats, and proso millet) that can derive from the randomness of sampling. Unfortunately, only three sites provided botanical samples for Roman Central Italy and their values have then been omitted from the plot. These sites (all from Tuscany) were studied by the Roman Peasant Project (Bowes and University of Pennsylvania, 2020) and only reported three kinds of cereal: common wheat, emmer, and barley. Similar ubiquity values from Northern and Southern Italy in the Roman age may suggest similar production patterns in the whole Italian mainland, even though more data is required. In the Late Roman age, ubiquity data has been calculated for the three macroregions, with Southern Italy being the least trustworthy (five sites in total). Three crops are found on 62.5-75% of the Central Italian sites: common wheat, barley and emmer. Other cereals are present, but less ubiquitously. The cereal triad aforementioned seems to be diffused in the south as well. Conversely, in Northern Italy common wheat and barley were indeed important cultivations but had to compete with other cereals including millet, sorghum, and rye. The latter had a significant increase, being present on almost 30% of the Northern sites (as opposed to the Roman 15%). The Early Medieval age seems to mark a shift in Italian agricultural practices, as cereal ubiquities are much more variable regionally. In Southern Italy, the triad of common wheat, barley and emmer were still the predominant cereals. These cereals are ubiquitous in Central and Northern Italy as well, although these regions adopt polyculture with a diversified number of cereals. The samples from the Medieval age are fewer in number since the upper boundary of this project’s chronology is the 11th c. Despite the short chronology, it is possible to make some considerations. Medieval Centraly Italy relied heavily on common wheat, barley and emmer, with other cereals increasingly important. Barley is the most ubiquitous cereal in Northern Italy in this period, followed by common wheat, millets and sorghum.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.3: Diachronical heatmap of cereals in the Italian macroregions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.1.2 Legumes\nIn the Roman Age, pulses are an important part of the diet and are cultivated both in Northern and Southern Italy. In the latter, vetch/broad beans are present in 22-32% of the samples, and lentils are present in 38% of the sites. In the Late Roman Age, broad beans are equally important in Central and Northern Italy, and peas are present in 50% of the Central Italian sites. In the Early Medieval Age, pulses are present in many Central Italian sites, especially blue/red peas, broad beans and other Fabaceae. Lentils and broad beans are also cultivated in almost half of the Northern Italian sites. The importance of pulses in Central Italy is confirmed by the 11th c. samples, where every specie is present in over 66% of the sites and Fabaceae and blue/red peas are found in every sample. Conversely, in Northern Italy broad bean is found in 66% of the sites.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.4: Diachronical heatmap of pulses in the Italian macroregions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.1.3 Fruits and nuts\nOlive and grape are two essential cultivations in the Italian peninsula.

    "text": "7.2 Site richness and diversity by chronology\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure to cite Nagendra (2002) to explain why the indices show different results.\n\n\n\nSpecies richness is a measure used in ecology consisting simply in the counts of species found at a certain location. In archaeology, it can be informative for assessing how many different plants were found at a site. For the calculation, only sites that provided cereals, legumes, fruits and nuts have been used. Although this choice entails the loss of many observations, it was necessary in order to produce more credible and comparable results. The graph shows extended credible intervals for groups with fewer observations.\nThe aim of the following model was to calculate the mean plant richness in each chronology. The distribution chosen for the model is a Poisson distribution, used when counts do not have a fixed upper boundary (as it is the case of a binomial distribution, for instance). The outcome variable is the richness (\\(R_{i}\\)) for each site \\({i}\\), calculated as follows\n\\[ R_{i} = \\sum_{n=1}^{k} Species_{ni}\\] where \\(k\\) is the total number of species in a site. The goal is then to model the mean richness \\(\\lambda_{i}\\). In addition to calculating four intercepts, one for each chronology \\(ChrID\\), the regression also includes a varying slope for each observation (\\(\\beta_{[Observations]}\\)). This will later be informative in quantifying on average how much the observations in each chronology deviate from the mean (\\(\\alpha_{[ChrID]}\\)). The formula for the Poisson regression is as follows, where priors for the intercept and slope have been chosen to be weakly informative, so that the range of the possible \\(\\lambda_{i}\\) will remain in the outcome space.\n\\[R_{i} \\sim Poisson({\\lambda}_{i})\\]\n\\[log {\\lambda}_{i} = \\alpha_{[ChrID]} + \\beta_{[Observations]}\\] \\[\\alpha_{[ChrID]} \\sim Normal(3,0.5)\\] \\[\\beta_{[Observations]} \\sim Normal(0,0.2)\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast to richness, diversity takes into account also each taxon’s abundance. It is important to notice that in this dataset this figure can be particularly biased by samples that are extremely dominated by one taxon. For instance, if a sample was collected in a processing area or in a storage it is likely to see one taxon dominating the others. Although this was the reason for choosing to work with presence or absence data in this project, diversity indices are still provided for thoroughness’ sake. In particular, two indices have been calculated—the Shannon equitability (H’) and Simpson indices, both ranging from 0 (for complete unevenness) to 1 (maximum diversity). The ecology R package vegan contains functions to perform these calculations. As for the case of richness, only complete observations (containing cereals, pulses, and fruits/nuts) have been taken into account. After calculating both indices for each sample, these values have been modelled both using a beta distribution as follows \\[ D_{i} \\sim Beta(\\mu_{i}, \\phi_{i}) \\] \\[logit(\\mu_{i}) = a_{[ChrID]}\\] \\[a_{[ChrID]} \\sim Normal(0,1.5)\\] \\[\\phi_{i} \\sim Exp(0.1)+2\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph shows extended credible intervals for groups (chronologies) with fewer observations. In particular, the Shannon equitability index showed higher variability in the 11th century. Consequently, its credible range is very wide."

    "text": "7.3 Context type\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant: This section has to be rewritten as now the approach is not frequentist anymore.\n\n\n\nIt is possible to examine the distribution of plants across different site types during the four phases under examination. During the Roman period, wheat and barley were most prevalent on rural and religious sites, in the latter being used as part of ritual offerings. Minor grains were widely distributed on religious and urban sites, with rural sites and villas also showing high percentages. Legumes were also used in religious offerings but were found on both urban and rural sites. Grapes were ubiquitous across all Roman sites, with particularly high percentages in urban contexts and being extensively cultivated in large Roman estates. Olives had lower percentages, as they cannot be grown in Northern Italy, where most of the samples were collected. However, they were still widely distributed across all contexts, with peak percentages in urban and religious sites. In the Late Roman period, olive presence significantly decreased in urban sites and villas, but remained relatively unchanged in rural contexts. Similarly to olives, grape decrease in the same contexts, but slightly increase in rural sites. In addition to rural sites, grapes are also diffused in over 66% of the fortified sites (castra) that start to appear in this period. It is noteworthy that fortified sites from the Late Roman period exhibit high percentages of both minor and noble grains, possibly being stocked with the addition of pulses such as faba beans and vetch. In the EMA phase, noble/minor grains and pulses are still present in almost any fortified sites, a situation that is similar to the one in rural sites. In rural sites however minor grains (40%) and pulses (32%) are less ubiquitous in this period, although this figure might suffer from sites that only published cereal remains. Grapes are present in every religious/funerary context, followed by fortified (71%) and rural sites (66%). If olive cultivation seem to decrease in this phase, it might be because most of the sites with archaeobotanical remains are located in Northern Italy. Olives are present in 50% of the religious sites and on 36% of villa sites. Olives are absent from fortified sites in all phases, probably as a reflection of the northern location of these sites. Both rural and urban sites increase the consumption of berries in this period (13-14% ca.), which are also used for funerary offerings (14%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant: The new section will start from here.\n\n\n\nTo estimate the probability of occurrence of one (or more) taxa in each chronology and context, I used a Binomial distribution. The \\(F\\) (short for ‘found’) on the left side of the formula is the outcome variable—a presence/absence indicator for the observation \\(i\\). In the case of a single taxon, the value can either be 0 (for absence) or 1 (for presence) and the \\(T\\) is 1, making the Binomial distribution effectively a Bernoulli distribution. If the model is for more than a single taxon, the \\(T\\) is the total number of taxa that are being modelled. For instance, in the case of ‘Noble Grains’, the model is trying to assess the probability that common wheat and barley will be on a site type in a certain chronology. The \\(T\\) value for noble grains will then be 2. The outcome variable \\(F\\) indicates the number of types of noble grains found on a particular site \\(i\\), and it can have values ranging from 0 (no noble grains found) to 2 (the site has both barley and common wheat). Although this is not the common way to use a binomial distribution, it was a necessary adjustment as I am working with presence/absence data. The model presented below is an intercept-only model, where the intercept \\(\\alpha\\) carries an interaction index \\({[TCid]}\\) as the model will provide estimates for each context type and chronology under examination.\n\\[\nF_{i} \\sim Binomial(T, \\bar{p}_{i} )\n\\]\n\\[\nlogit(\\bar{p}_{i}) = \\alpha_{[TCid]}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\alpha_{[TCid]} \\sim Normal(0,1.5)\n\\] The rationale behind choosing a normally distributed prior for the intercept \\(a\\) is that it is weakly informative. Below, a simulation of the intercept prior.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.6: Prior predictive simulation for the binomial models used in this section. If for instance we want to know how many minor grains (out of seven types) each site was adopting, this prior is weakly informative because it shows no trends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(rethinking)\nlibrary(tidybayes.rethinking)\nlibrary(tidybayes)\n\n####################\n## NOBLE GRAINS\n####################\n\nNoble_Grains <- with(\n  Df_Cond_Plants.pa,\n  data.frame(\n  Chronology = Chronology,\n  Macroregion = name_macroreg,\n  Site_Type = as.factor(Type),\n  Geo = Geo,\n  Grain_Count = rowSums(Df_Cond_Plants.pa[,c(11,15)])\n  )\n)\n\n#Simplify categories\nNoble_Grains$Site_Type <- str_replace(Noble_Grains$Site_Type, \"Religious, monastery\", \"Religious\")    \nNoble_Grains$Site_Type <- str_replace(Noble_Grains$Site_Type, \"Castle\", \"Fortified\")    \nNoble_Grains$Site_Type <- str_replace(Noble_Grains$Site_Type, \"Castrum\", \"Fortified\")  \n\n# Convert to list\nNoble_Grain.list <- list(\n    NG_Found = Noble_Grains$Grain_Count,\n    NG_Tot = 2,\n    TC_ID = as.factor((interaction(Noble_Grains$Chronology, \n                                   Noble_Grains$Site_Type)))\n   )\n\nNoble_Grain.list$TC_ID <- droplevels(Noble_Grain.list$TC_ID)\n\n\n####################\n## MINOR GRAINS\n####################\n\n# Convert to list\nMinor_Grains_Type.list <- list(\n    MG_Found = Minor_Grains$Grain_Count,\n    MG_Tot = 7,\n    TC_ID = as.factor((interaction(Minor_Grains$Chronology, \n                                   Minor_Grains$Site_Type)))\n   )\n\nMinor_Grains_Type.list$TC_ID <- droplevels(Minor_Grains_Type.list$TC_ID)\n  \n\n####################\n## LEGUMES \n####################\n\nLegumes <- with(\n  Df_Cond_Plants.pa,\n  data.frame(\n  Chronology = Chronology,\n  Macroregion = name_macroreg,\n  Site_Type = as.factor(Type),\n  Geo = Geo,\n  Seed_Count = rowSums(Df_Cond_Plants.pa[,c(21,27)]) # Excludes Unsp.

As not every sample reported cereals, fruits/nuts and legumes, a correction has also been applied to exclude contexts that did not report the three types of plant taxa under examination. This correction has however strong disadvantages as it removes sites where the absence of certain plant categories may have been deliberate (e.g., storages). However, if the figures vary considerably (especially in the case of the 11th century CE which only consists of 2 samples after the correction), the general trend is similar after the correction. Plant richness in urban contexts slightly decreases after the Roman age, but early medieval cities are richer in plants when compared to the Roman and Late Roman phases. In the 11th century, plant richness increases further. These values will be discussed in the results chapter.\n\n\nTable 7.1: Plant richness in urban contexts before and after (*) removing incomplete samples.\n\n\nChronology\nRichness\nSamples\nRichness*\nSamples*\n\n\n\n\nR\n6.5\n44\n8.45\n22\n\n\nLR\n5.9\n24\n7.2\n10\n\n\nEMA\n7.2\n25\n9.6\n8\n\n\nMa\n9\n8\n17.5\n2"

The chosen distribution is a Binomial where \\(F\\) (short for ‘found’) on the left side of the formula is the outcome variable—a presence/absence indicator for the observation \\(i\\). In the case of a single taxon, the value can either be 0 (for absence) or 1 (for presence) and the \\(T\\) is 1, making the Binomial distribution effectively a Bernoulli distribution. If the model is for more than a single taxon, the \\(T\\) is the total number of taxa that are being modelled. The model presented below is an intercept-only model, where the intercept \\(\\alpha\\) carries an interaction index \\({[REGid]}\\) as the model will provide estimates for each context type and chronology under examination.\n\\[\nF_{i} \\sim Binomial(T, \\bar{p}_{i} )\n\\]\n\\[\nlogit(\\bar{p}_{i}) = \\alpha_{[REGid]}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\alpha_{[REGid]} \\sim Normal(0,1.5)\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.9: Bayesian probability estimates for noble grains (common wheat and barley), divided by macroregion and chronology.

As there are seven types of minor grains under investigation, the binomial will take 7 as maximum (\\(T\\)). This model effectively shows the probability of a single site to be reliant on minor grains. Emmer for instance, is ubiquitous in Italy, but in many cases it is the only minor grain found among other cereals in a context. Modelling the presence of more minor grains in a site can give insights on the rural economy. The model presented below is an intercept-only model, where the intercept \\(\\alpha\\) carries an interaction index \\({[REGid]}\\) as the model will provide estimates for each context type and chronology under examination.\n\\[\nF_{i} \\sim Binomial(7, \\bar{p}_{i} )\n\\]\n\\[\nlogit(\\bar{p}_{i}) = \\alpha_{[REGid]}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\alpha_{[REGid]} \\sim Normal(0,1.5)\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.10: Bayesian probability estimates for minor grains (Emmer, Einkorn, Foxtail and Broomcorn millets, Sorghum), divided by macroregion and chronology.

By using measure space, the null hypothesis that the centroids and dispersion of groups are identical is tested. The null hypothesis is rejected if either the centroid or the spread of the objects differs between the groups. A prior calculation of the distance between any two objects included in the experiment is used to determine whether the test is valid or not2 (Anderson, 2017). In this context, the null hypothesis is that there is no regional difference in the cereals dataset, with cereals being evenly distributed across macroregions and chronologies.\n\n\nThe suggestion of an Early Medieval shift in cereal farming stated in Section 7.1.1 and Section 7.4.1.3 needs statistical support. Considering that data is not unimodal and that we are dealing with presence/absence analysis, the best choice is to use a non-parametric test as PERMANOVA on the early medieval botanical dataset. Prior to performing the test, it was necessary to pre-process data by:\n\nSelecting all the cereals columns of the plant remains table, keeping the categorical variables: Macroregion.\nRemoving empty rows (samples that only reported seeds/fruits, but not cereals).\nSelecting only samples that had at least 10 seeds.\nTransforming the raw counts into presence/absence, using the function decostand() (method=pa) in the R package vegan (Oksanen et al., 2020).\n\nAfter the pre-processing, it was possible to run the PERMANOVA using the function adonis2() in the package vegan. The function creates a distance matrix and computes an analysis of variance on the matrix. The method chosen to calculate the distance matrix is the jaccard distance. The Jaccard distance, based on the Jaccard similarity index, is a value of dissimilarity between sample sets (Kosub, 2019). When compared to other dissimilarity indices, it is more appropriate for presence/absence analyses as it is not based on Euclidean distance.\n\n\n\nPermanova\n## PERMANOVA WITH adonis()\nset.seed(29)\nPermanova.Cereals.R = adonis2(\n  Bot_PA_data.R ~ Macroregion, \n  data = Bot_PA_categ.R,\n  permutations = 10000, \n  method=\"jaccard\"\n)\n\nPermanova.Cereals.EMA = adonis2(\n  Bot_PA_data.EMA ~ Macroregion, \n  data = Bot_PA_categ.EMA,\n  permutations = 10000, \n  method=\"jaccard\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 7.7:  Results of the PERMANOVA for the Roman and Early Medieval phases. \n \n  \n    Phase \n    R2 \n    p-value \n  \n \n\n  \n    Roman \n    0.03 \n    0.0977902 \n  \n  \n    Early Medieval \n    0.10 \n    0.0001000 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe calculation of PERMANOVA on the Roman dataset using the variable Macroregion reported a not statistically significant p-value, suggesting a degree of homogeneity. On the other hand, when applied to the early Medieval dataset, the results were highly significant (0<p<0.001) with a 99.99% confidence. PERMANOVA has not been calculated on the Late Roman dataset as samples from Southern Italy were too scarce. To confirm the significance of the results of PERMANOVA applied to the EMA dataset, it is necessary to check that its assumptions are met (especially since we are dealing with small groups of data). Firstly, we check the homogeneity of variances. The function betadisper() from the package vegan provides the distances of group samples from centroids. If the variation is even, the null hypothesis of no difference in dispersion between groups is accepted. To test the variation, it is possible to use the analysis of variance (ANOVA).\n\n\nBetadisper\n## BETADISPER\n\n# Creating distance matrix for the R period\nDistMat.R <- vegdist(Bot_PA_data.R, \n                       method=\"jaccard\", \n                       na.rm=TRUE)\n\n# Creating distance matrix for the EMA period\nDistMat.EMA <- vegdist(Bot_PA_data.EMA, \n                       method=\"jaccard\", \n                       na.rm=TRUE)\n\n# Betadisper: distances of group samples from centroids\nBetadisper.R <- betadisper(DistMat.R, \n                             Bot_PA_categ.R$Macroregion)\nBetadisper.EMA <- betadisper(DistMat.EMA, \n                             Bot_PA_categ.EMA$Macroregion)\n\n# Printing distances:\nBetadisper.GroupDistances = data.frame(\nPhase = c(\"Roman\", \"Early Medieval\"),\n\"Northern Italy\" = c(Betadisper.R$group.distances[1],Betadisper.EMA$group.distances[1]),\n\"Southern Italy\" = c(Betadisper.R$group.distances[2],Betadisper.EMA$group.distances[2])\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 7.8:  Group distances from centroids. \n \n  \n    Phase \n    Northern Italy \n    Southern Italy \n  \n \n\n  \n    Roman \n    0.53 \n    0.48 \n  \n  \n    Early Medieval \n    0.37 \n    0.38 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetadisper\n# Checking that the distance from the centroids is not significant:\nAnova.R = anova(Betadisper.R)\nAnova.EMA = anova(Betadisper.EMA)\n\nAnova_Betadisper_Results = data.frame(\n  Phase = c(\"Roman\", \"Early Medieval\"),\n  p_value = c(Anova.R$`Pr(>F)`[1], Anova.EMA$`Pr(>F)`[1])\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 7.9:  p-values of the ANOVA on the betadisper for the Roman and Early Medieval phases. \n \n  \n    Phase \n    p-value \n  \n \n\n  \n    Roman \n    0.1892284 \n  \n  \n    Early Medieval \n    0.9374030 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Roman - Groups and distances to centroids on the first two PCoA axes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Roman - Boxplots of distances to centroids.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Early Medieval - Groups and distances to centroids on the first two PCoA axes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Early Medieval - Boxplots of distances to centroids.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.12: Results of the betadisper() on the Roman and Early Medieval datasets.\n\n\nThe betadisper() graphs (Figure 7.12) show similar distances from the centroids for the categories Northern Italy and Southern Italy. In addition, the ANOVA on the betadisper() shows that the separation is not significant (p-value over the significance threshold), meaning that the groups dispersions are homogeneous. We can thus be confident in the PERMANOVA results and accept the difference between the two groups of sites under investigation. In other words, the Southern and Northern Italian group of sites are different during the Early Middle Ages for what concerns cereal farming.\nRunning the same tests on the Roman sites failed to separate the two groups of sites, confirming that there was not a significant difference in the types of cereals cultivated during the Roman age between Northern and Southern Italy.\n\n\n7.4.1.5 Quantifying the separation: nMDS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes on terminology: Wasserstein metric\n\n\n\nThe Wasserstein distance (or earth’s mover distance) is a measure of distance between two probability distributions on a metric space.\n\n\nIn addition to statistically testing the separation between the Northern and Southern Italian early medieval cereals dataset (Section 7.4.1.4), it is possible to measure the distance between groups of sites both in the Roman and early Middle ages. For this task, a dimensionality reduction algorithm has been chosen: the non-metric multidimensional scaling, from the R library vegan. A more in-depth explanation of the algorithm can be read in Section 6.4.2.3. To avoid fallacy in computations, the macroregion Central Italy and the chronologies LR (Late Roman) and Ma (11th c. onwards) have been excluded from this test—the uneven distribution of the group of samples required a cautious approach. The nMDS has been run with a reduction to only one dimension, using KDE plots to visualize the results. Setting the dimension to one allows easier calculations of distance. In Figure 7.13 (a), it is possible to see the nMDS performed on the Roman cereals presence/absence dataset. As already pointed out, the PERMANOVA did not produce significant results for this dataset and the Wasserstein distance (calculated with the wasserstein1d() function in the transport library) is indeed shorter for the Roman dataset. For both chronologies there is an overlap in the curves, which is more considerable in the Roman age (indicating that the group of samples are more similar). The overlap for the EMA groups (Figure 7.13, b) is probably due to the fact that the presence of the noble grains is not by itself a ‘marker’ of Southern Italian sites—these grains are also very common in the North. The difference is that in the South noble grains are not cultivated in conjunction with other grains. The graph for the EMA chronology shows a clearer separation of the macroregional groups, with some minor overlaps. Moreover, the graph also displays variability in the Northern Italian dataset. The variability can also be assessed from the outliers in the boxplots in Figure 7.13.\n\n\nnMDS and Wasserstein distance\nlibrary(ggpubr)\n# Perform the metaMDS to 1D for Df_Cereals_R and Df_Cereals_EMA \nmds_R <- metaMDS(Bot_PA_data.R, k=1, distance = \"jaccard\")\nmds_EMA <- metaMDS(Bot_PA_data.EMA, k=1, distance = \"jaccard\")\n\n# Add the Macroregion data to the metaMDS results for both dataframes\nmds_df_R <- data.frame(mds_R$points, Macroregion = Bot_PA_categ.R$Macroregion)\nmds_df_EMA <- data.frame(mds_EMA$points, Macroregion = Bot_PA_categ.EMA$Macroregion)\n\n# Create dataframes to calculate wasserstein distance\nlibrary(transport)\n\nMDS_Scores_R_SI <- (subset(mds_df_R, Macroregion==\"Southern Italy\"))$MDS1\nMDS_Scores_R_NI <- (subset(mds_df_R, Macroregion==\"Northern Italy\"))$MDS1\n\nMDS_Scores_EMA_SI <- (subset(mds_df_EMA, Macroregion==\"Southern Italy\"))$MDS1\nMDS_Scores_EMA_NI <- (subset(mds_df_EMA, Macroregion==\"Northern Italy\"))$MDS1\n\n       \n# Create the plots\nmds_R.plot <- ggplot(\n  data=mds_df_R, \n  aes(x=MDS1, \n      group=Macroregion, \n      color=Macroregion, \n      fill=Macroregion)) +\n    geom_density(adjust=1.5, alpha=.2) +\n      geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(MDS_Scores_R_SI)),\n            color=\"#90a955\", linetype=\"dashed\", linewidth=.8)+ #South\n      geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(MDS_Scores_R_NI)),\n            color=\"#212529\", linetype=\"dashed\", linewidth=.8)+ #North\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#212529\",\"#90a955\"))+\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"#212529\",\"#90a955\"))+\n  theme_pubclean()+\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")+\n    labs(\n      title=\"Roman age\",\n      caption = paste0(\n      \"PERMANOVA: p > 0.05 \\n\",\n      \"Wasserstein distance: \", round(\n      wasserstein1d(MDS_Scores_R_SI,MDS_Scores_R_NI),2\n      )))\n\nmds_EMA.plot <- ggplot(\n  data=mds_df_EMA, \n  aes(x=MDS1, group=Macroregion, color=Macroregion, fill=Macroregion)\n  ) +\n  scale_alpha(guide = 'none')+\n  geom_density(adjust=1.5, alpha=.2) +\n  geom_vline(\n    aes(xintercept=mean(MDS_Scores_EMA_SI), color=\"mean\"),\n    color=\"#90a955\", linetype=\"dashed\", linewidth=.8)+ #South\n  geom_vline(\n    aes(xintercept=mean(MDS_Scores_EMA_NI)),\n    color=\"#212529\", linetype=\"dashed\", linewidth=.8)+ #North\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#212529\",\"#90a955\"))+\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"#212529\",\"#90a955\"))+\n  theme_pubclean()+\n    labs(\n      title=\"EMA\",\n      caption = paste0(\n      \"PERMANOVA: p < 0.0001 \\n\",\n      \"Wasserstein distance: \", round(\n      wasserstein1d(MDS_Scores_EMA_SI,MDS_Scores_EMA_NI),2\n      )))+\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\")\n\n\nmds_R.boxplot <- ggplot(mds_df_R, aes(x=Macroregion, y=MDS1, fill=Macroregion)) + \n    geom_boxplot(alpha=.2)+\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#212529\",\"#90a955\"))+\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"#212529\",\"#90a955\"))+\n  theme_pubclean()+\n    labs(\n      title=\"Roman Age\")+\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\nmds_EMA.boxplot <- ggplot(mds_df_EMA, aes(x=Macroregion, y=MDS1, fill=Macroregion)) + \n    geom_boxplot(alpha=.2)+\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#212529\",\"#90a955\"))+\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"#212529\",\"#90a955\"))+\n  theme_pubclean()+\n    labs(\n      title=\"EMA\")+\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Roman - KDE curves of the nMDS.

    "text": "7.5 Altitude\nThe creation of altitude models was not possible for every plant investigated in this study. As the process is very time consuming, it was necessary to select only plants that are most likely to be either positively or negatively impacted by altitude, or taxa that are cultivated for economic reasons. Primary importance was thus given to cereals. Since not every cereal can be cultivated at high altitudes, it was more appropriate to model them individually instead of grouping them into noble and minor grains. For reference, below is a breakdown of the elevation of sites during the four chronologies under investigation.\nThe probability of occurrence of the most common cereal remains can be modelled against the elevation of sites in the four time periods under consideration. It is worth noting that the sites where the archaeobotanical remains have been found are not evenly distributed. In the Roman age, most sites investigated are located between 0 and 100 MSL, whereas after there is an increasing number of remains from sites between at higher elevations. Whether this reflects a real shift in settlement patterns is outside the aims of this study, but it might still be informative to visualise the different distribution of sites across elevations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.5.1 Model specification and priors\n\\[\nP_{i} \\sim Bernoulli(\\bar{p}_{i})\n\\]\n\\[\nlogit(\\bar{p}_{i}) = \\alpha_{[ChrID]} + \\beta_{[ChrID]}\\cdot Alt_{i}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\alpha_{ChrID} \\sim Normal(0,1.5)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\beta_{ChrID} \\sim Normal(0,1.5)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\phi \\sim Exponential(1)\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.21: Prior predictive simulation for the altitude models used in this section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.5.2 Cereals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.5.2.1 Community plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.22: MCMC estimates for slope and intercept plotted in the logit scale.

    "text": "7.8 Cereal proportions\nThe computations on the archaeobotanical dataset that have been done so far are based on presence/absence values. The reasons relate to the numerous biases present in the samples, which skew the distributions. However, this approach does not allow to draw any quantitative conclusion. From a qualitative standpoint, it can be informative to see which sites are producing different results by calculating the ratio of single cereal taxa on the total of cereal grains found in a certain sample. For the sake of exploring the quantitative trends, keeping in mind that these results are heavily biased by outliers and sample sizes, summary tables grouped by chronology were produced. In particular, two tables are presented here. The first (Table 7.10) takes into account missing values, so that if a particular taxon was not found in a sample the missing value was converted to 0. The second table (Table 7.11) calculates the means only based on true presences, and missing values are ignored from the computation. In addition to these two tables, a different approach has also been presented. Raw data has been converted into relative ranks, which assigns increasing ranks to the count values (excluding zeros) on a scale of 0 to 1, thus minimizing the impact of extreme outliers and reducing the effects of large differences in values. Table 7.12 displays the means of the relative ranks, grouped by chronology. In all three approaches, the computations have been based only on totals of cereals attributed to a species. Although these tables allow some considerations on the proportions of cereals in the sites under investigation, it is important to remember that the results might be biased by the quality of the samples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 7.10:  Means of the proportions of cereals, calculated on the total of cereals.

    "text": "8.1 Data exploration\nAs previously mentioned, the faunal dataset used in this study exhibits overdispersion, which is a common issue when analysing datasets of this type. The term ‘overdispersion’ refers to the presence of greater variability in the data than expected based on a normal curve (Figure 8.1). In this section, I will present the distribution of the animals of interest to provide a visual representation of the dispersion within the dataset. By examining the distribution curves, we can better understand the variability that exist within the dataset, and can use this information to develop more accurate models. In Figure 8.2, it is evident that the distribution of animal remains in the faunal dataset is not symmetrical and does not conform to a normal curve. This non-normal distribution indicates that the standard measures of central tendency, such as mean and median, may not accurately capture the overall distribution of the data. Traditional statistical measures, such as measures of central tendency and dispersion, are commonly used in frequentist approaches to analyse data. However, these measures may not be appropriate for analysing the complex patterns of animal farming and consumption in the faunal dataset due to the presence of overdispersion. As an alternative, Bayesian multilevel models can account for overdispersion by incorporating appropriate probability distributions, such as the betabinomial distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1: Probability density curves of three simulated normal distributions, representing underdispersed (sd = 0.5), normal (sd = 1), and overdispersed (sd = 2) data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.2: Distribution of animal remains in the dataset, displayed both by NISP raw value and NISP proportions."

    "text": "8.2 Chronology\n\n\n\n\n8.2.1 Trends by century\nThe proposed model uses a betabinomial distribution to model overdispersion in the data and estimates the precision (or shape) parameter \\(\\phi\\) in the Beta distribution. The \\(A\\) on the left side of the formula is the outcome variable, which represents the animal NISP count for each observed sample \\(i\\). The model is intercept-only, meaning that there are no further predictors included in the model. The average probability of success \\(\\bar{p}_{i}\\) is modelled through a logit link function, and is assumed to equal the intercept \\(\\alpha\\). The model is also indexed with \\({[Century]}\\) so that separate estimates can be obtained for each century (1st BCE to 11th CE).\n\\[\nA_{i} \\sim BetaBinomial(NISP_{i}, \\bar{p}_{i} , \\phi_{i})\n\\]\n\\[\nlogit(\\bar{p}_{i}) = \\alpha_{[Century]}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\alpha_{[Century]} \\sim Normal(0,1.5)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\phi_{[Century]} \\sim Exponential(1) + 2\n\\] The prior distributions selected for the model are weakly informative. Specifically, the prior chosen for the intercept \\(\\alpha\\) is a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.5. Given that \\(logit(\\bar{p}) = \\alpha\\) is modelled using the logit link, a mean of 0 corresponds to a probability of 0.50 on the logit scale. With a standard deviation of 1.5, the prior is flat and only slightly informative.\nAs for the shape parameter \\(\\phi\\), the prior was selected to ensure that the parameter was at least 2, which corresponds to a flat distribution. This value (2) was then added to an exponential distribution with rate 1 to produce a weakly informative prior.\nA prior predictive simulation (Figure 8.3) shows how when no information is provided to the model, counts on the extremes of the binomial histogram are more likely, while all other counts have similar probabilities. Bimodal priors are common practice with Beta distributions as they are non-informative enough. However, updating a bimodal prior even with one observation rapidly changes the posterior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) The simulation shows how when no data is available values on the limits are likely. New observations however rapidly affect the posterior distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Conjugate beta distribution.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.3: Prior predictive simulation for the betabinomial distribution.\n\n\nThe model for pigs’ NISP counts shows a positive trend above the millennium average (0.36) for predicted high density intervals (HDIs) from the 1st century BCE to the 3rd century CE. The probability intervals exhibit a steady decrease that begins in the 3rd century and continues until the 8th century, when the mean of the probability distribution coincides with the first millennium average. Despite positive trends reported in the 8th and 9th centuries, interpretation of these values requires caution since the credible intervals are wider due to fewer observed samples dated to these centuries. The HDIs mean for the 10th and 11th centuries is again around the millennium average, indicating a decrease in the probability of pig occurrence.\nCattle, on the other hand, exhibit different trends, with a HDI interval in the 1st century BCE above the millennium average (0.20), although with a large credible interval, and a negative trend from the 1st to the 3rd century CE. HDIs are again increasingly positive between the 4th and 7th centuries, but decrease in the 8th century. As for pigs, HDIs means are close to the millennium average in the 10th and 11th centuries.\nThe modelled probability of occurrence of caprine reveals a positive trend in the 1st century BCE, followed by a negative trend (below the average of 0.28) from the 1st to the 3rd century CE. The probability of occurrence then increases around the 4th/5th centuries up to the 6th/7th centuries, with HDIs stable around the mean from the 8th to the 11th century. The edible wild animals that were included in the analysis are Sus scrofa ferus (boar), Cervus elaphus (red deer), Dama dama (fallow deer), Capreolus capreolus (roe deer), Lepus sp. (hare), Glis glis (dormouse), and unspecified birds. The domestic fowl species that were analysed are Gallus g. (chicken) and Anser A. (goose). Edible wild animals and domestic fowl predicted probabilities are relatively stable trends throughout the analysed period, with HDI means consistently below 0.10. Domestic fowl HDIs remain below the millennium mean of 0.06 from the 1st century BCE to the 2nd century CE, and then increase steadily from the 3rd century to remain around the mean until the 7th century. From the 7th to the 11th century, the HDIs remain positive, but with a much larger credible interval. Similarly, wild animals’ HDIs are positive in the 1st century BCE and remain stable around the millennium average (0.05) until the 6th century CE, after which they also show a slight increase until the 11th century.\nIn addition to plotting the probabilities of occurrence extracted by the models, the distributions of the precision parameter \\(\\phi\\) are plotted for samples in each century. Each line is plotted with two probability intervals 0.65 (shorter thicker line) and 0.99 (longer thinner line). The probability density functions are also added to the top of the bar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.2 Trends by phase\nThe relationship between animal NISP counts and chronological phases is similar to the previous one, but with a different indexing variable for the intercept. Instead of being indexed by century, the intercept \\(\\alpha\\) is now indexed by phase (\\({[ChrID]}\\)). While a phase can span several centuries, this modification allows the model to estimate separate intercepts for each phase, providing more specific insight into potential differences in the outcome variable and the average probability of animals occurrences over time. The rest of the model structure and distributional assumptions remain the same as the previous model, which uses a betabinomial distribution to model overdispersion in the data and an intercept-only structure.\n\\[\nA_{i} \\sim BetaBinomial(NISP_{i}, \\bar{p}_{i} , \\phi_{i})\n\\]\n\\[\nlogit(\\bar{p}_{i}) = \\alpha_{[ChrID]}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\alpha_{[ChrID]} \\sim Normal(0,1.5)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\phi_{[ChrID]} \\sim Exponential(1)+2\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs anticipated, the phase-level trends exhibit posterior distributions similar to the more detailed century-level results. However, the phase-level model offers an advantage - the credible intervals are considerably narrower than those of the previous model. Since each phase spans several centuries, except for the medieval phase that only includes the 11th century, there are more data points available to provide more reliable probabilities. Pigs’ NISP are at their highest point during the Roman phase, whereas they decrease in the Late Roman and Early Medieval phase, only to be slightly below the millennium average (of 0.37) in the 11th century. The predicted millennium average is comparable to the previous century-level model (0.36), with a small difference which can be due to the grouping of the observations. The diachronical means for the other animals are also very comparable to the other with a maximum difference of ±1 for each animal. Cattle’s NISP probabilities of occurrence increase throughout the millennium, although in the 11th century (marked as Ma on the plot) the 99% credible interval is larger, spanning from 0.15 to 0.26. Conversely, the century-level model for this period indicated a small increase towards the millennium average. As for the century-level model, the caprine are the second most represented animal in the millennium. Their probability of occurrence shows HDIs just below the millennium mean (of 0.27) in the Roman and Late Roman age, and positive HDIs values for the Early Medieval and Medieval phase, a situation not so different than the century-level model. The phase-level trends for domestic fowl and wild animals show perhaps clearer trends than the century-level models. The HDI for domestic fowl, which is below the millennium mean of 0.05 in the Roman age, slightly increases in the later phases, with a peak in the 11th century. This peak is however less reliable than other phases, as the credible interval range is much larger. Wild animals posterior probabilities on the other hand are stable around the mean (0.04) with a small increase in probability during the Early Medieval and Medieval phases. In addition to improved credible intervals as opposed to the century-level model, the probability intervals for the \\(\\phi\\) shape parameter are also more reliable, as the PDFs are more narrow and most of the values are around the mean. Unfortunately, a smaller amount of samples for the 11th century produced more dispersed curves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.2.1 Community plot\nAfter estimating the intercepts for each animal separately, they were compiled together to get a cohesive view of the probability of occurrence of the four animals. This approach is not ideal, but it can still be informative with regards to the patterns of animal exploitation in the archaeological record. The joint community plot allows to visually compare the probability of occurrence of each animal species over time and identify trends in their occurrence. For instance, the plot below shows how the predicted probability values for the three main domesticates—pigs, cattle and caprine vary across the four phases. Pigs have higher probabilities during the Roman phase, while already in the Late Roman period they get closer to other domesticates. It is in this period that the inter-sample variability of \\(\\phi\\) seem to decrease, although the values are not very high. The precision \\(\\phi\\) is instead very variable for edible wild animals and domestic fowl, as it can be expected given that it is much rarer to find these animals in a sample for various reasons already discussed in the methods. The high variability in the precision of the medieval (11th century) intercept and \\(\\phi\\) estimates can be explained by the lower number of samples. Overall, the most noticeable trends in the plot are the increased number of cattle in the early medieval period and the decreased number of pigs from the Late Roman phase. Modelling each animal species separately does not fully capture the complex interactions that exist among them, and future work should explore more advanced modelling approaches that account for the co-occurrence of multiple animal species in the same samples."

    "section": "8.3 Context type",
    "text": "8.3 Context type\nChronological models provide a broad overview of the trends in domestic and wild animal husbandry and consumption. However, it is important to consider the context where the animal remains are found because different site types can influence the NISP of a particular animal. We can stratify the dataset by site type, but there is a challenge: the four chronologies we are studying also affect the availability, frequency, and economic dynamics of the site types. For example, the agricultural strategies employed by rural villas during the Roman and Late Roman periods could differ based on political and economic events, which could affect the relative amount of animal NISP. To better understand how the context where animal remains were found affects our outcome variable, the NISP, we can use a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). In this DAG, the Chronology node is a parent of the Site_Type node, and it affects the NISP count directly and indirectly through Site_Type. To account for this backdoor path, we block by Chronology and stratify the dataset by Site_Type. Since we have two categorical predictors of interest, we can use an interaction index variable to generate distinct intercepts for each chronology and context type. For instance, the Roman:Rural context type could be assigned an index of 1, while Roman:Urban could be assigned an index of 2, and so on. This interaction dummy index (\\({[TCid]}\\)) will determine the variation in intercepts (\\(\\alpha\\)) across different context types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.4: This is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that represents the relationship between Chronology, Site_Type, and NISP in the study. Chronology is shown as a collider variable, and its influence on NISP is mediated through Site_Type. To block the backdoor path between Chronology and NISP, the dataset is stratified by Chronology.\n\n\n\n\nThe approach for the proposed model for estimating the posterior likelihood of animal occurrence in various chronological phases and context types is very to the models discussed earlier. The only modification is the interaction index. The model structure and priors remain the same as in the previous models. There are several contexts that have been recorded in the database (see Table 5.1 for a full list), but the model required some simplifications in order to avoid extremely small categories. For instance, religious monasteries have been grouped with other Religious sites, or Roman mansiones have been classified as Rural for these models. Categorical simplifications can obscure the nuances of data, but tiny sample sizes produce very uninformative posterior distributions.\n\\[\nA_{i} \\sim BetaBinomial(NISP_{i}, \\bar{p}_{i} , \\phi_{i})\n\\]\n\\[\nlogit(\\bar{p}_{i}) = \\alpha_{[TCid]}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\alpha_{[TCid]} \\sim Normal(0,1.5)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\phi_{[TCid]} \\sim Exponential(1) + 2\n\\]\n\n8.3.1 Pigs\nAs previously noted, pig remains are consistently the most frequently found type of faunal remains in first millennium Italian excavations. However, this study reveals divergent patterns in the presence of pigs depending on the site type and function. We will first discuss categories with narrower credible intervals before moving on to those with smaller sample sizes and wider credible intervals. Urban sites are the most common category, where the probability of finding pig remains follows patterns similar to the chronological trends presented earlier. During the Roman phase, the probability of finding pig remains in urban contexts is very high compared to other animals or categories, with a mean probability of almost 0.5. The consumption of pork in cities appears to have decreased during the Late Roman and Early Medieval phase, with similar credible intervals, only to increase again in the 11th century. Possible hypotheses will be discussed later on. Although the precision of the pig beta posterior in urban contexts is slightly below the across-contexts mean of 5, the curves are not too dispersed, at least in the Roman and Late Roman periods, and we can be confident in these results. On the other hand, the 95% HDIs for pigs in rural contexts are lower than those in urban contexts during the Roman and Late Roman periods. In the Early Medieval phase, the mean probabilities are comparable to urban contexts, with both categories having a mean of around 0.31, which then increases to 0.37 in the 11th century (0.39 in urban contexts). In general, while the decline in pig presence appears to be significant in urban areas, rural contexts exhibit only a slight increase. Rural villas have been analyzed separately from other rural sites due to their potential implications for the production and consumption of meat, given their status as elite sites. Although the sample size is not large enough to provide highly confident posterior predictions, the results suggest that pork was likely an important component of the diet in these sites, with a mean of approximately 0.4 in the Roman period and an increase in the Late Roman phase. However, the Early Medieval phase is characterized by greater uncertainty, as the sample size is reduced and rural estates often changed function or were abandoned. The credible interval for this period ranges from 0.25 to 0.62. The suggested increase in pigs NISP in the Late Roman period will be discussed further later, as the historical debate might provide helpful hypotheses. It is worth noting that there is no sample from the 11th century for rural villas, which is why that line is not included in the graph. Fortified sites were also large consumers of pigs, with the probabilities of occurrence sticking around the mean value and a minor increase in the Early Medieval-Medieval periods. However, there are no significant changes in trends to observe. The probabilities of occurrence in the Late Roman phase are not so trustworthy as the credible interval is large. It is worth noting that there is no Roman posterior prediction on the graph because there were not fortified Roman sites in the sample except for one, the castrum of Ostia (MacKinnon, 2014), which has not been included in the observed data for this model as it was one single sample. The castrum had a 71.9% NISP proportion of pigs, out of a sample of 121 total NISP. The religious category has fewer observations than the site types presented before, and the credible intervals are wider. The Roman and Late Roman religious sites mostly include temples such as the temples C and D of Grumentum, the Demetra temple in Macchia delle Valli, the Mithraeum of Crypta Balbi, and more. In the Medieval phases, religious sites are mostly monasteries including the well-studied ones of Monte Gelato, Farfa, San Salvo, S. Giulia of Brescia, and San Vincenzo al Volturno. The range of credible intervals can span probabilities of 0.40, so we must be cautious in our considerations. If we look at the mean of the HDIs, a precise pattern does not emerge. However, in every chronology, the probability of occurrence of pig’s NISP is over the across-contexts average of 0.41. The credible intervals for necropolis sites are too large - spanning almost the entire probability range - to trace any clear patterns. With only nine samples from seven sites, including the Roman and Late Roman necropoleis of Cantone, Otranto, San Cassiano (Riva del Garda), Trieste (loc. Crosada), Poggio Gramignano, San Lorenzo di Sebato, and the Early Medieval necropolis of Baggiovara, the sample size is small. As a result, it is best to draw only qualitative conclusions in the later discussion. Finally, the last category includes only one well-known site, the Flavium amphitheater in Rome, which provided 29 zooarchaeological samples. The 95% HDIs for this site show very high probabilities, with mean values of 0.65 for the Roman and Late Roman periods and 0.49 for the Early Medieval period. However, the credible interval is quite wide for the Early Medieval phase, making it less certain. This type of site was not grouped with the other urban observations as it was too unique.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPigs are recognized as indicators of urban environments since pig rearing is primarily for meat production. This dataset contains numerous samples from Rome and Ostia, which is its neighboring port city. It is possible to model the “metropolitan” influence that these cities may have on the probability of discovering pig remains in urban areas. By doing so, we can calculate the differences in probabilities between Rome and other urban sites to gain insights into their varying likelihoods. Results show how pigs were more markedly present in Rome than other Italian urban centres, although they follow the same chronological decreasing trend as other cities.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of samples from Early Medieval and Medieval (11th century) Rome is relatively small compared to other urban centers. Additionally, considering the historical context, the metropolitan effect of Rome is likely diminished during this time period. Therefore, the differences in probabilities were specifically computed for the Roman and Late Roman phases, focusing on these particular periods rather than encompassing the broader historical range. In the Roman phase, there is a bigger difference between Rome/Ostia and other Italian cities (with a mean probability of 0.20). Later, this difference decreases to a mean of 0.15.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.3.2 Cattle\nThe probabilities of occurrence of cattle remains in different context types have thinner credible intervals compared to pig remains credible intervals. In urban sites, no significant changing pattern can be observed, as the means of the 95% HDIs mostly lay on the mean probability of 0.20 across contexts, with the exception of the Roman period where it was below mean. Medieval urban sites exhibit increased variability, possibly due to higher uncertainty associated with less data. The mean precision (\\(\\bar{\\phi}\\) = 7 ca.) in medieval urban sites is the highest of any category. Rural contexts show more variability in probability trends and are more in line with the results of the chronological models. The credible intervals are slightly wider than urban contexts, but can still be interpreted and discussed later. In the Roman age, the probability of cattle occurrence is highest in rural sites, increasing after the 2nd century and slightly decreasing in the Medieval phases. Rural villas show stronger trends than rural sites, but with even more uncertainty. If in rural sites probabilities of occurrence of cattle NISP remains increases in the Late Roman period, in villas there is an opposite trend with cattle probabilities going below the mean. As previously mentioned, data on Early Medieval rural villas are scarcer due to the changing functions of these sites and their lower continuity. Only six sites provided nine samples in this period: Ficarolo (loc. Gaiba-Chiunsano), Monte Torto di Osimo, Santa Marta, Villa Magna, S. Giovanni di Ruoti, and Faragola. Consequently, the resulting analysis for this category has higher uncertainty and wider credible intervals. However, the probabilities suggest a small increase again in this phase. The posterior precision parameter (\\(\\bar{\\phi}\\)) in this phase is the lowest, indicating both less data available and contradictory information in the data, contributing to the uncertainty. Fortified sites, while exhibiting more uncertainty during the Late Roman period, do not show significant changes in cattle NISP occurrences. The mean values of the 95% HDIs remain consistently above the overall mean of 0.20 in all chronologies, but only show a slight increase to around 0.25 in the Medieval period, with a higher precision. The trends in religious sites show similarities to those in villas, with mean probabilities dipping below the across-contexts average in the Late Roman period and a steady increase in the Early Medieval and Medieval phases. In necropoleis, the probabilities of cattle NISP are below the mean in the Roman-Late Roman periods. However, in the Early Medieval phase, due to limited data availability (only one sample from the necropolis of Baggiovara, where cattle NISP is 74/316), the uncertainty is high, and the credible interval is too wide to draw any meaningful conclusions. This extended credible interval is due to the flat prior, indicating that the model is too uncertain to provide reliable probabilities. The final category consists of only one site, the Flavium amphitheater. The probability of occurrence of cattle NISP remains in this category is relatively low and does not follow the same patterns as urban sites. There is a small decrease in the Late Roman period and a potentially uncertain increase in the Early Medieval phase. However, the 50% HDI probabilities are consistently below the across-contexts mean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf pigs can act as a marker of urbanization, it is also important to investigate whether the consumption patterns of other animals in Rome differ from those in other urban centers. Additionally, while pigs were primarily raised for meat consumption, cattle had further purposes beyond meat production (e.g. agricultural purposes, leather production, etc.). To overcome this issue, it would be ideal to control for factors such as age and wear, even though this is outside the boundaries of this research and biometric data is not stored in the database. It is essential to keep this context in mind when interpreting the graphs and drawing conclusions. In contrast to pigs, the analysis reveals notable distinctions in cattle consumption trends between Rome and other urban sites across different chronological phases. One notable observation is that cattle appears to be more commonly consumed in other urban cities compared to Rome. Additionally, while cattle consumption decreases in Rome during the Late Roman period, it concurrently increases in other cities. It is worth noting that the credible intervals in Rome are relatively high, limiting further comparisons in other periods. However, there seems to be a positive trend again in the early medieval phase. The graph depicting the differences illustrates a narrower gap between Rome/Ostia and other cities during the Roman period, whereas the disparity becomes more pronounced in the Late Roman phase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.3.3 Caprine\nAmong the contexts analyzed, the probability of finding caprine remains is the second highest with a mean of 0.29, following pig remains. In Roman and Late Roman urban sites caprine probabilities are below the mean, although there is a positive trend until the Early Middle Ages. The Medieval phases (6th to 11th century) show mean probabilities of 0.31. Rural sites exhibit a decreasing trend, with the 50% HDIs always above mean. However, even with this decreasing trend, the probabilities in rural sites are still higher than those in urban sites. In the Roman period, the caprine probability of occurrence is particularly high (0.35) in rural sites and decreases in the following phases, until the 11th century, when there is a strong increase in caprine probabilities (associated with more uncertainty and variability). Rural villas show a decreasing trend in the probabilities of caprine remains: the 50% HDI probabilities in rural villas remain lower than the average, with a slight decrease in the Late Roman phase and a strong increase in the Early Medieval period, when uncertainty is also high. Although the number of samples is not as high as other categories, the mean precision (\\(\\bar{\\phi}\\) = 8.5 ca.) is high in the Late Roman phase, indicating consistency in the samples. In fortified sites, there is a decreasing trend in caprine probability, starting from a high point of 0.37 in the Late Roman phase and reaching below the average of all contexts in the 11th century. As for the case of most categories (except urban sites), there is a decreasing trend in caprine probability until the 11th century in religious sites. However, for this category the credible intervals are quite wide, and the precision is always below average, making it challenging to draw reliable conclusions. In the case of necropoleis, the credible intervals are too large to provide any meaningful insight. Finally, in the Flavium amphitheater samples the 50% HDIs probabilities are below average, decreasing in the Late Roman period and increasing (with extreme uncertainty) above average in the Early Medieval phase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegarding sheep and goats, similar differences were calculated between Rome/Ostia and other urban sites. The overall chronological trends in urban sites do not exhibit significant variations, while Rome and Ostia show an increasing trend, although with a larger credible interval after the Roman period. In this case as well, the differences in probabilities of finding sheep/goat remains in Rome/Ostia versus other urban sites are negative, suggesting that these animals were consumed more in other cities than in the capital. However, during the Late Roman phase, the mean probability approaches zero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.3.4 Edible W. Animals\nThe trends in edible wild animals are similar between urban and rural sites, with mean probabilities below the average of 0.07 during the Roman and Late Roman periods. The means for urban sites are around 0.03, while those for rural sites are approximately 0.05. In the Early Medieval period, both urban and rural sites show a small increase, with probabilities of 0.05 and 0.06, respectively. In the Medieval period, the 50% HDIs are above the mean for both urban and rural sites, reaching a peak of 0.11 in rural areas. However, caution is required for the 11th century, as the credible interval is larger and the mean precision (\\(\\bar{\\phi}\\)) is low, indicating increased variability. While the credible intervals are wider, rural villas consistently have means above the average and higher than other site types. In the Roman period, the mean probability is 0.11, which decreases to 0.09 in the Late Roman phase and 0.05 in the Early Middle Ages. Similarly, fortified sites display 50% HDIs above the across-context mean, with a small decrease in the Early Medieval phase and an increase in the 11th century. Both sites show a positive correlation between game consumption and elite lifeways. Religious sites show probabilities above the mean in the Roman and Late Roman periods, when these sites mostly include temples or ritual contexts. However, in the Medieval phases, the probabilities decrease below the mean instead. The credible intervals for the necropoleis are too wide to draw any reliable conclusion, but it is noteworthy that there is evidence of wild game consumption in these contexts. The Flavium amphitheater also exhibits probabilities below the mean, although the full credible interval extends above the mean as well. In the Early Medieval phase, the mean probability rises above 0.10, but the credible interval remains too wide for confident interpretation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.3.5 Community plot\nTo examine the overall trends across all context types and chronologies, the probabilities of occurrence for the four animals were compiled and plotted against the precision. The resulting plot shows different context types and chronologies for each animal. Since these are separate models, multinomial regressions would be informative in this sense. These models could be explored further in future research. In the Roman period, the probabilities for pigs and wild animals show clear separation among urban, rural, and villa sites. Pigs are mostly predicted in urban sites, followed by villas and rural sites. Conversely, wild animals have higher probabilities in villas, then rural and urban sites. For pigs, most of the \\(\\phi\\) values range between 3 and 8 across all contexts, while the wild animals model shows low precision values for villas and greater variability in urban and rural sites. Additionally, wild mammal probabilities in villa sites vary widely, ranging from 0.05 to as high as 0.20. In contrast, the probabilities of wild mammal occurrence in urban and rural sites are more consistent. The probabilities of cattle and caprine in different contexts are less clear. Rural sites have higher probabilities for both animals than urban sites, and the probabilities for villas have wider ranges. However, adding a fourth site type in the Late Roman period complicates the reading. As for the Roman period, pigs and wild animals show a separation, with pigs being more likely in urban sites and wild animals in villas, but there is a shift in probabilities in the Late Roman period. Pigs are now more likely in villas, whereas wild animals remain similarly distributed. Fortified sites have variable probabilities for all animals. Cattle is more present in rural sites, followed by urban and villa sites, while caprine is most likely to occur in fortified sites (with high variability), followed by rural, urban, and villa sites. The latter show a higher degree of precision. In the Early Medieval period, there is less distinction between the different context types for all animals, except for cattle, which is more likely to occur in rural sites, followed by urban and villa sites. There are no clear trends for the other animals. In the 11th century, there is a lot of variability for all animals, possibly due to the smaller sample size. Pigs appear to be more common on urban and fortified sites, while cattle and caprine are more likely to occur on rural sites. The patterns of probabilities for wild animals are highly inconsistent."

    "text": "8.4 Macroregion\nIn addition to considering chronological and context type models, another important variable that has been examined in this study is Macroregion. This allows us to divide the Italian peninsula into three regions (Southern, Central, and Northern) and investigate more specific geographic questions. Due to the limited amount of data available, it is not however feasible to build on the previous model and incorporate this variable into the analysis. Additionally, including three categorical predictors would make it difficult to interpret the results. To account for the influence of Macroregion, we can stratify the dataset by Southern, Central, and Northern Italy, similar to how we stratified by Site_Type. It is important to also consider chronological stratification as different dynamics were occurring in the areas under observation. Therefore, we can block by Chronology and stratify by Macroregion to investigate the influence of geographic location on animal husbandry and consumption patterns.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.5: The DAG that represents the relationship between Chronology, Macroregion, and NISP in the study.

However, some observations can still be made. Firstly, it’s noticeable that Southern and Central Italy share similar trends, albeit with different estimated probabilities. In the Roman period, Central Italy has the highest 95% HDI for pigs, with a mean probability of 0.51, well above the across-regions mean of 0.36. Although 50 out of 99 samples from this period are from urban contexts, the 30 samples from rural contexts are sufficient to avoid suspicions of biases. Similarly, the credible interval is wider in Southern Italy, with a mean probability of around 0.43. For both regions, the trend shows a decreasing probability of pig occurrence in the Late Roman and Early Medieval periods. In Central Italy, the 95% HDI mean values reach the across-regions mean in the Early Middle Ages, while in Southern Italy, most probabilities are already below the mean in the Late Roman period. The analysis reveals a different pattern for Northern Italy compared to Southern and Central Italy. The probability of pigs in Northern Italy shows only a slight decrease in the Late Roman period, from 0.27 to 0.26. However, there is an apparent increase in the probability of pigs during the Medieval phases, although the 11th century remains uncertain due to limited observations. Conversely, in Southern and Central Italy, the trend is decreasing in the Late Roman and Early Medieval periods. While the 11th century shows a slight increase in both regions, the credible interval for Southern Italy is too wide to draw any meaningful conclusions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.4.2 Cattle\nSimilar patterns are observed for the occurrence probabilities of cattle in Southern and Central Italy. In the Roman and Late Roman periods, the 50% HDIs for Southern and Central Italy are lower than the across-regions mean of 0.23. However, in the Early Middle Ages, the probabilities increase in both regions and go above the mean. In contrast, Northern Italy shows much higher mean probabilities in the Roman (0.27) and Late Roman (0.32) periods compared to the other regions, but the mean decreases to 0.24 in the Early Middle Ages. Due to wide credible intervals, it is difficult to provide accurate estimates for the 11th century.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.4.3 Caprine\nThere are distinct patterns in caprine occurrence probability across the three regions examined. In Central Italy, the probability of caprines is consistently lower than the across-regions mean of 0.31, ranging from 0.24 to 0.26 in the Roman age to the Early Middle Ages. While the 11th century credible interval is wide, most probabilities are above the mean. The model precision is particularly good in Roman and Late Roman Central Italy, with a peak of around 8. Roman Northern Italy has the highest probability of caprine occurrence in the Roman age, with a mean value of 0.36. However, after this period, the mean probabilities decrease below the mean, only to increase again in the 11th century. Nevertheless, the probability distribution for this period is not reliable. Southern Italy, on the other hand, shows a steady increase in probability from the Roman age, with the 50% HDI around the mean, to a peak of 0.41 in the Early Middle Ages. However, the wide credible interval and low model precision in the 11th century prevent definitive conclusions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.4.4 Edible W. Animals\nThe distribution of edible wild animals in the Roman and Late Roman periods is below the across-regions mean of 0.05. In Central Italy, there is an increase in the probability of game consumption from the Roman to the Medieval age, with an uncertain trend in the 11th century. The precision parameter \\(\\bar{\\phi}\\) is also high in the Medieval phase. Similarly, Northern Italy shows an increase in the probability of game consumption in the Medieval phases, while the mean probabilities decrease after the Roman age. Southern Italy, on the other hand, has a stable trend from the Roman to the Early Medieval period, with an uncertain increase in the 11th century. The credible interval is wide, and the model might have produced estimates in agreement with the other regions. However, there is evidence of an increase in game consumption in the 11th century in every macroregion."

This research has considered plains, coasts, hills and mountains as the most common geographical features in the Italian peninsula. The majority of excavations that returned faunal samples are located at low altitudes. Although - as can be expected - Northern Italy provided more samples from mountain sites when compared to the other parts of mainland Italy, the other samples seem to be evenly located on on plains, coastlands and hills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.6: Distribution of sites on different geographical features.\n\n\n\n\nThe proposed model includes two categorical predictors—Chronology and Geography.

The interaction between these two variables is obtained through a dummy index (\\({[GEOid]}\\)) that is used to estimate intercepts for each period and geography. Geographical features can influence the differential distribution of animal remains. For instance, we might expect to find more caprine NISP remains in mountain sites. It is however also important to consider the time factor, as changes in settlement patterns and economic strategies over time may have been driven by political events. We do this by stratifying again by chronology in addition to geographical features. The priors used for this model are the same as in the previous models.\n\\[\nA_{i} \\sim BetaBinomial(NISP_{i}, \\bar{p}_{i} , \\phi_{i})\n\\]\n\\[\nlogit(\\bar{p}_{i}) = \\alpha_{[GEOid]}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\alpha_{[GEOid]} \\sim Normal(0,1.5)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\phi_{[GEOid]} \\sim Exponential(1)+2\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n8.5.1 Pigs\nThe data suggests that the probabilities of finding pig remains are generally higher in lowland areas, including coasts, plains, and hills, with mean probability values above the overall mean of 0.35 during the Roman period. However, there appears to be a general decrease in the 95% HDIs during the Late Roman period, with the decline being more pronounced in plains where the mean probability drops from 0.49 to 0.34. In plains, probabilities increase above the mean only in the 11th century, whereas on coastal sites, the credible interval becomes wider in the 11th century, and the mean remains below the average. Although the association between hills and pig remains probabilities seems to be always above average, there are no major patterns of chronological change. In mountains, pig remains are always below the mean, but there seems to be an increase (associated with a good amount of uncertainty, as indicated by the low precision parameter and wide credible interval) in the Early Medieval Age. Unfortunately, no clear indication can be given for the Medieval phase on mountains, given the wide credible interval that spans the entire probability range. This is due to the limited availability of samples for this period and geographical feature: the castrum of Rocca di Asolo (pigs NISP: 220/698 and 529/1837), the Toblburg Castle (94/346) and Rocchetta Nuova of Vacchereccia (60/258).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.5.2 Cattle\nIn this model, the overall predicted probabilities of cattle are consistently lower than those of other animals, with an average of 0.25. However, mountain sites show a higher mean probability for cattle compared to other geographical features. On the coasts, there is a chronological increase in cattle probabilities, with a mean value going above the overall mean in the 11th century, albeit with higher uncertainty due to the fewer available sites. Conversely, on hills and plains, the probabilities of cattle increase only slightly. What is particularly noteworthy is the trend observed in mountain sites, despite the higher uncertainty due to the lower number of available sites. Here, there is an increase in probabilities during the Late Roman period, from a mean of 0.25 to 0.35, followed by a decrease in the Early Medieval period, although with a wider credible interval. In the 11th century, the credible interval again spans across the entire probability range, with no clear indication of the trend. Four samples from three sites are available for this period: the castrum of Rocca di Asolo (cattle NISP: 265/698 and 395/1837), the Toblburg Castle (204/346) and Rocchetta Nuova of Vacchereccia (120/258).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.5.3 Caprine\nThe average probability for the occurrence of caprine remains is 0.34 across all geographical features. On coastal sites, the mean probabilities are below average in the Roman-Late Roman periods, but increase slightly in the Early Medieval phase and go above mean in the 11th century, although the credible interval is high and the \\(\\bar\\phi\\) is below mean. This increase is also seen on hills, where mean probabilities are below mean until the Early Medieval phase and decrease slightly below mean again in the 11th century. On plains, the mean probabilities are always below mean - as can be expected - but generally increase. Credible intervals for mountain sites are very wide, and thus require caution in interpretation. The general trend seems to be in decline from the Roman to the Early Medieval phase from a mean of 0.55 to 0.45. Again, it is impossible to draw conclusions for the 11th century phase on mountains as only four samples from three sites are available: the castrum of Rocca di Asolo (caprine NISP: 164/698 and 523/1837), the Toblburg Castle (48/346) and Rocchetta Nuova of Vacchereccia (68/258).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.5.4 Edible W. Animals\nNISP from wild animals is always low, and the probabilities of occurrence show little variation, as most mean probability values lay around the mean of 0.09. Overall, there is a positive association between 11th century sites and game consumption in all geographical features. On plains, mean probabilities are above mean already in the Early Medieval period. Again, it is hard to draw conclusions for medieval mountain sites as there are only four samples available: the castrum of Rocca di Asolo (NISP: 12/698 and 39/1837), the Toblburg Castle (0/346) and Rocchetta Nuova of Vacchereccia (0/258)."

    "section": "8.6 Altitude",
    "text": "8.6 Altitude\n\n\n\nThe probability of occurrence of the most common faunal remains can be modelled against the elevation of sites in the four time periods under consideration. It is worth noting that the sites where the zooarchaeological remains have been found are not evenly distributed. In the Roman age, most sites investigated are located between 0 and 100 MSL, whereas after there is an increasing number of remains from sites between 100 and 400 MSL. Whether this reflects a real shift in settlement patterns is outside the aims of this study, but it might still be informative to visualise the different distribution of sites across elevations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proposed model to estimate the probability of occurrence as related to the altitude (the slope \\(\\beta\\)) and chronology (\\({[ChrID]}\\)) uses a betabinomial distribution to model overdispersion in the data. The \\(A\\) on the left side of the formula is the outcome variable—the animal NISP counts for each observation \\(i\\). This is a simple intercept with slope model, where the intercept \\(\\alpha\\) carries an index \\({[ChrID]}\\) as the model provides estimates for each chronology under examination. A single \\(\\phi\\) parameter indicates the precision in the Beta distribution.\n\\[\nA_{i} \\sim BetaBinomial(NISP_{i}, \\bar{p}_{i} , \\phi_{i})\n\\]\n\\[\nlogit(\\bar{p}_{i}) = \\alpha_{[ChrID]} + \\beta_{[ChrID]}\\cdot Alt_{i}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\alpha_{ChrID} \\sim Normal(0,1.5)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\beta_{ChrID} \\sim Normal(0,1.5)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\phi \\sim Exponential(1)+2\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.7: Prior predictive simulation for the altitude models used in this section.\n\n\n\n\n\n8.6.1 Pigs\nThe model shows a negative correlation between an increase in elevation and the probabilities of finding pig remains. This result was already suggested in the models with the geographical features as a predictor. In fact, although the variability increases at higher altitudes (due to the more restricted number of samples available), pig remains are more likely to be found in lowlands in all chronologies. The mean precision \\(\\bar\\phi\\) for the four chronologies is 5.41.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.6.2 Cattle\nIf pigs showed a negative trend with increased elevations, cattle shows an opposite pattern. In every chronology, probabilities of finding cattle are much higher at high elevations. The Early Medieval and Medieval phases show the strongest association between higher elevations and a larger number of cattle NISP remains. However, the Medieval and Roman datasets do not include samples above 1.2km.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.6.3 Caprine\nThe correlation between sheep/goats NISP and elevation is perhaps the most interesting when stratified by chronology. In the Roman and Late Roman phases, there is a positive correlation between altitude and the probability of finding caprine NISP, meaning that caprine are more likely to be found at high altitudes. However, in the Early Middle Ages, this trend diverges. The correlation begins to become negative, although not markedly, suggesting that there are changing trends. This trend becomes increasingly negative in 11th century sites. The mean precision \\(\\bar\\phi\\) for the four chronologies is 7.57.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.6.4 Edible W. Animals\nIn contrast, modeling the number of wild animal NISP remains against altitude was not very informative. The probability of occurrence of these species is always low, so elevation does not seem to be a major factor in their distribution. The prediction line appears to indicate no correlation, although if we include the 0.99 credible interval, the correlation is potentially positive in all chronologies. The model performed very poorly on 11th century sites, because not many sites reported wild animal remains and the credible intervals are quite wide. In other chronologies, the credible intervals are not very large and the overall mean precision parameter \\(\\bar\\phi\\) is 15.65, indicating that the data was not very dispersed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.6.5 Community plot\nTo examine the overall trends across all phases and different elevations, the probabilities of occurrence for the four animals were compiled and plotted against the slope coefficient (which in the models is multiplied by the elevation). The resulting plot shows probabilities of occurrence of each animal at different elevations. The horizontal dashed line represents the probability of finding each animal at sea level. It is worth reminding that these are separate models, and further research should explore other models, for instance multinomial models. In the Roman period, pigs were the most likely remains to be found, with probabilities ranging from 0.40 to 0.45. Most of the probabilities are negative, indicating a negative correlation with altitude. This suggests that pigs were more likely to be raised in lower-lying areas. Wild animals were also negatively correlated with altitude, but the correlation was not as strong as for pigs. Caprine and cattle were the second and third most common animal remains found, respectively. They were both positively correlated with altitude. In the Late Roman period, the probability of finding pig remains decreased to 0.35-0.34, while the probabilities of finding wild animal, caprine, and cattle remains remained more or less the same. This suggests that pigs may have become less common in this period. In the Early Medieval period, the probabilities of finding cattle and caprine remains increased to 0.17-0.26 and 0.26-0.34, respectively, while the probability of finding wild animal remains decreased to 0.05-0.10. Although cattle and caprine may have become more common in this period, pigs probabilities of occurrence did not change being still the most common species found in zooarchaeological samples. It is interesting to notice how in this period caprine probabilities are negatively correlated to the elevation of sites. This correlation becomes more markedly negative in the 11th century phase. In this last phase, there was increased variability in the probabilities of finding all four animal remains. This may be the result of a smaller amount of samples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.8: MCMC estimates for slope and intercept plotted in the logit scale. Negative slopes indicate a negative relationship between the animal remains and increasing altitude. Intercepts were kept as a baseline occurrence probability of the species. Species on the left of the graph are rarer, species on the right are more common. It is important to notice that this represents the species response to elevation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMacKinnon, M., 2014.

    "text": "10.1 Environmental data for site type classification\nRandom forest algorithms are a popular method for classification in machine learning, and they have been applied to a wide range of problems. In this dissertation, they can be used to classify archaeological sites from the first millennium CE based on their botanical and faunal datasets. By removing categories that create bias due to insufficient data, the accuracy of the models can be improved.\nIn this study, I investigated whether the botanical and faunal datasets from archaeological sites from the first millennium CE could be used to accurately classify the type of site. To do this, I built random forest models for both datasets and evaluated their performance on a test set.\nBefore building the models, I preprocessed the datasets by removing categories that were likely to introduce bias or lead to misclassification. In the botanical dataset, I removed the Religious and Religious, monastery categories. In the faunal dataset, I removed the Necropolis category due to its low number of entries and tendency to be misclassified as Urban. I also removed the Rural site, mansio, and Shipwreck categories from the faunal dataset due to their low number of entries. Finally, the Castrum and Castle categories were merged in both datasets.\nAfter preprocessing the datasets, I split them into train and test sets, and used the train set to build the random forest models. I then used the models to predict the class labels of the instances in the test set, and compared these predicted labels to the true labels to evaluate the performance of the models.\nThe results of the study showed that both the archaeobotanical and zooarchaeological variables can be good predictors for site type. The archaeobotanical model had a predictive accuracy of 67%, and the zooarchaeological model had an accuracy of 76%. In both models, the classes that were most accurately classified by the random forests were Castles and Castra, and Urban and Rural sites. It is interesting to note that the model sometimes classifies rural villas as “Urban” and sometimes as “Rural”, accurately predicting their class label only about 50% of the time.\nOverall, this study demonstrates that random forest algorithms can be effectively used to classify archaeological sites from the first millennium CE based on their botanical and faunal datasets. By carefully preprocessing the datasets and selecting appropriate categories, the accuracy of the models can be improved, leading to more accurate predictions of site type.\n\n\nLibraries\n# Required libraries\nlibrary(vegan)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(randomForest)\nlibrary(caret)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData manipulation\n############################################################################\n##\n## Reformat the data so that:\n## 1.

    "text": "2.5 Research framework: Statistics in Archaeology\nGeneral introduction (from Shennan (1997) ?)\nIn archaeology, multivariate statistics has been applied since the mid-60s, when the spread of computers and statistical packages made these methods more easily applicable. The growing popularity of computational archaeology in this period also owes a great debt to the New Archaeology movement (or Processual archaeology). New Archaeology emphasized the application of rigorous scientific analysis at the expense of the cultural historical approach which focused on artifacts cataloging based on ethnic grouping (Binford and Binford (1968)).\nInclude Baxter and Drennan\n\nDiscuss the rationale for using a multi-source archaeological study, integrating environmental proxies such as animal and plant remains.\nExplain the significance of using a Bayesian approach to multilevel modeling and the application of beta-binomial models for data analysis.\nJustify the use of the selected datasets and the importance of a holistic approach.\nA limit is that most studies use qualitative rather than quantitative approaches in economy (Mattingly and Salmon, 2001)"
