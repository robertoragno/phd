Cattle medians slightly decrease after the Roman age, even though surprisingly (put a reference here to literature review to explain why surprisingly) the values increase again (18–19.71%) during the early Medieval and Medieval age. The trends for sheeps and goats are also interesting. During the Roman age the Italian median is 25%, slightly decreasing in the 3rd to the 5th century, and increasing again after. When discussing sheep-farming, one must always consider the geographical features from which the data is being collected. This will be discussed later on in the chapter, where more regional and geographical trends will be provided. Domestic fowl (chickens and geese) has quite stable values of 4-5%, with a peak of 7.68% in the 11th century. Wild game peaks during the Roman age, with a median value of 5%, reaching a minimum in the early Middle ages (2%) and rising again in the 11th century. Two considerations must be made for game consumption. The first is that as we will see later on, game consumption is strongly related to the site typology. Secondly, the Roman age value is pulled up by assemblages from the 1st century BCE. After that, the values strongly decrease and by looking at the individual centuries the medians from the 7th century onwards are much higher (ranging from 1.42% to 2.09%).\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 8.2:  Weighted medians of zooarchaeological remains, divided by century. \n \n\n\nFaunal remains\n\n  \n      \n    Pigs \n    Cattle \n    Caprine \n    Domestic fowl \n    Wild game \n  \n \n\n  \n    1st c.

    "text": "3.2 Archaeobotany\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection in progress\n\n\n\nShould the maps be here? Or maybe here put time slices maps\n\n\nThe objective of archaeobotany is to recover, identify, and document plant remains from archaeological sites to reconstruct past vegetation dynamics, human-environment interactions, and food production and consumption patterns. Archaeobotany can also be referred to as “palaeoethnobotany”, a term especially prevalent in North America. Although the word “palaeoethnobotany” places a stronger stress on the human and ethnic interaction with plants (Hastorf and Popper, 1988), the two words are used mostly interchangeably (Hastorf, 1999) as European archaeobotanists share the same objectives. It is important to emphasise that the term “palaeobotany” is not a valid synonym for archaeobotany, as it refers to the study of past evolution and adaptations of plants, and this discipline is not concerned with human-environment interactions (Fuller and Lucas, 2014). In Classical archaeology, some of the archaeobotanical research questions can also be inferred from historical literature. This is problematic, as the evidence often contradicts what is said in texts; Pearsall (2015, p. 27) remarks how the discipline works using an archaeological approach, not an historical one. Furthermore, the domain of archaeology stretches far beyond the chronological range of textual history. In the archaeological record, four types of botanical remains can be identified—macroremains, pollen grains, phytoliths (inorganic elements found in leaves, stems, and other parts of plants), and starches (formed by amylose or amylopectin polymer aggregates) (Pearsall, 2015). As most archaeobotanical studies in Italy deal with macroremains and pollen, this research will only focus on these remains.\n\n3.2.1 Macroremains\nMacroremains such as seeds, nutshells, fruit pips, and charcoal (wood preserved after carbonisation) are visible to the naked eye (> 0.25 mm). It is possible to recover macrofossils—in situ, by screening using sieves, and by flotation. In situ collection is possibly the most problematic, as it relies on the experience of the excavator and favours larger finds. In addition, light conditions and the colour of the soil might influence the ability to visualise seeds and charcoal remains. A solution to this problem is to use screening techniques, and choosing an appropriate mesh size can limit the bias for underrepresented taxa (e.g. particularly small seeds). Often, sieves of different mesh sizes are used at the same time for the purpose of eliminating as much soil as possible from the soil sample. In addition to dry screening, archaeologists also use wet screening. Wet screening refers to the practice of pouring water onto the sieve. It differs from wet sieving, which requires the submersion of seeds in a bucket with water that is gently agitated. In any case, adding water to the sieve can be counter-productive, as wetting might destroy the seeds if they are charred (White and Shelton, 2014). One of the most common types of recovery is by flotation, which encompasses several techniques, each based on the principle that water is denser than charred material. Flotation can be either manual or machine-assisted. The former refers to wet sieving, where seeds are submerged in water and the ones that float are recovered using a mesh. Tools and machines have been also developed for flotation, including the hand-pump (which does not require electricity) and other machine-assisted tools that use water pressure and aeration to separate the seeds from soil. Flotation also allows the recovery of other small-sized archaeological material, including fish and bird bones, and mollusca (Jarman et al., 1972; Turney et al., 2005, p. 125; Williams, 1973). After separating the seeds from the soil, seeds can be identified and quantified. For the identification, researchers use fossil reference collections and photographs (Turney et al., 2005).\n[INSERT IMAGE OF FLOTATION MACHINE USED AT PANTANELLO (Costantini & Costantini Biasini p 373)]\n\n3.2.1.1 Sampling\nA sample is a smaller subset of elements from a population. In statistics, a population is the entire set of elements which we can draw inferences from. Often, it is not possible to know how large is the population, which is then called universe. Whether consciously or not, archaeology has always dealt with sampling. Much of the archaeological record has been lost or destroyed in time, and what we are able to study is a smaller portion of what once was present (Drennan, 2010, p. 80). If we consider the entire statistical population what is currently available to the archaeologist, it would be possible to sample for instance each bucket of soil excavated and count the total number of seeds found. This will certainly provide the most accurate information, although it is almost never possible in real life situations. Common constraints are time, funding, number of excavators, etc. It is then up to the archaeologist to decide how to collect samples, which will be biased by definition since they will not reflect reality. Why bother with sampling then? Archaeobotanical macroremains can be smaller than 1 mm and sampling can provide more information than collecting seeds with the naked eye (i.e. no sampling) (Orton, 2000, p. 148). Moreover, an effective and robust sampling strategy can limit bias as far as possible and try to return meaningful samples. Depending on the context, resources and individual decisions, several possibilities are available—interval sampling, probabilistic sampling, judgemental sampling, total sampling, or no sampling at all (Jones, 1991). The first, interval (or systematic) sampling, consists in sampling at regular intervals. The intervals can be defined in space (samples evenly spaced out in a grid), in time (sampling every tot. minutes or every \\(n\\)-th bucket), or in the laboratory using a riffle box (a machine designed to divide samples). One drawback of this method is that the regularity in sampling might correspond to a regular pattern in the data, which may bias the results. Probabilistic sampling is a method often advocated for, but rarely used. This type of sample has the advantage of allowing the researcher to draw statistical inferences on the data collected, for instance to calculate the margin of error and confidence intervals. The simplest form of probabilistic sampling is random sampling, for example randomly choosing to sample a square from a grid or a bucket from a series of buckets. Another approach to random sampling is cluster sampling, which requires a prior division of the sampling population into clusters (e.g. by context, area, etc.) and then randomly select some of these clusters during excavation (Orton, 2000). One of the problems that may arise from random and cluster sampling approaches is that of spatial autocorrelation. As Waldo Tobler (1970) puts it:\n\nThe first law of geography: Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.\n\nOther forms of sampling include judgemental sampling, a feature based approach and total (or blanket) sampling which consists in taking a certain amount of soil from each excavated context. Both methods will be discussed more in detail below. Finally, an excavation can have no sampling at all. Most of the archaeobotanical samples with macroremains recorded in the database were collected using different types of visual sampling, not always made explicit by the authors. Visual sampling occurs when archaeologists can visually see or expect (i.e. judgemental sampling) macroremains in the feature they are excavating. Common features from which samples are usually collected include—pits, hearths, filled anforae, etc. But “how can one argue that the contents of a pit reflect activities involving food specific to that context, if one has not examined samples from floor deposits into which the pit was dug, or the deposits overlying it?” (Pearsall, 2015, p. 75). Lennstrom and Hastorf (1995) lament “feature biases” in many archaeological excavations, as paleobotanists are often called after archaeologists have already recovered materials from specific site features. The authors call for a general misconception in the goal of archaeobotany—to collect as many macroremains as possible. This strategy is, in fact, not very informative about the relationships between plant remains and stratigraphic units, and the general deposition patterns in the site. For instance, Jones et al. (1986) were able to reconstruct the functions of structures and the methods of crop storage at Assiros, northern Greece, through a thorough extensive sampling. Pearsall (2015, p. 74) recommends a “blanket sampling” strategy, which consists in collecting samples for flotation from each stratigraphical unit. The advantages of blanket sampling are manifold:\n\nIf in theory sampling from strategical features (e.g. hearths) maximizes the chances of recovering more macrobotanical remains, in practice this is not always the case. For instance, if a hearth was used on a regular basis, it could possibly have been cleaned of ashes frequently, and the excavator might have more luck sampling around it.\nIncluding the collection of samples from each layer in the excavation leads an uniform and standardised procedure, reducing the variation across samples.\nBlanket sampling allows an easier reconstruction of deposition patterns and of stratigraphic units relations as stated above. For instance, one can analyse differences in macroremains densities across samples.\n\nIn addition to choosing the most efficient sampling strategy, sample size is also a problem that has been discussed in archaeobotany. The sample size, often indicated in litres in archaeological reports, can be constant or variable depending on the context. The size can have important repercussions on the richness of the sample, a topic that will be dealt with more extensively in the chapter discussing the methods used in this thesis. In short, a particularly small sample size can affect the number of species found. In particular, rare species may be either not represented or under-represented (Pearsall, 2015, p. 160). While archaeobotanists have advocated for more specific sampling strategies for over 40 years, very few of the Italian excavations in this dataset applied blanket or probabilistic sampling, and collecting samples from features is still the most common practice.\n\n\n3.2.1.2 Preservation\nThere are several ways in which seeds can be preserved, among them charring (or carbonisation), mineralisation, waterlogging, desiccation, metal oxide preservation and as imprints in ceramics (Fuller and Lucas, 2014). This section will focus only on grain preservation, excluding wood remains, as anthracological data (charred wood) has not been recorded on the database. The mode of preservation has a strong effect on the species of plants that can be found in the archaeological level. Cereals and nuts have higher chances of being preserved by charring, while fruit pips, herbs and spices are most common in waterlogged sediments. Nuts, fibrous and oil-rich plants are also equally preserved under water. Desiccation greatly preserves several parts of a plant, although it occurs very rarely (Veen, 2018, p. 71). These factors influence the representation of plants in the archaeological context, and one must be aware that the most identified taxa may represent the plants that had the best chance of being preserved. The most represented taxa therefore do not necessarily coincide with the most numerous or used plants at the site being investigated (Pearsall, 2015, p. 42). Figure 3.1 and Figure 3.2 show how different preservation methods affect the representation of a taxon.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Preservation mode of species with more than five occurrences in northwestern Europe in the Roman period [c= charred, m = mineralised, w = waterlogged, u = unknown]. Image after Livarda (2018).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Preservation mode of three plant groups in medieval Britain [black = charred, white = waterlogged, grey = mineralised]. Image after Veen et al. (2013).\n\n\nA final comment must be made on the state of preservation of botanical macrofossils. Regardless of how the seeds have been preserved from deposition to the time of excavation, the state of preservation of individual seeds may also be affected by mechanical actions such as fragmentation or erosion. Indeed, it is not uncommon for an archaeologist to find seeds that are only partially intact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Fragmentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Erosion\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Several stages of fragmentation and erosion of seeds of Sparganium erectum. Image after Jones et al. (2007, p. 79)\n\n\n\n3.2.1.2.1 Charring\nCarbonisation is the most common way of finding seeds when excavating an archaeological site, most notably when using flotation on the samples. Carbonisation occurs when seeds (or other botanical materials) are exposed to fire at not excessively high temperatures and under anaerobic conditions so that the combustion process is not completed. Other factors include the proximity to the fire source, fuel type and elements associated to the seed (i.e. chaff and straw) (Turney et al., 2014, p. 93). Several experiments have been carried out to understand the way in which carbonisation takes place and for a review of the literature on this topic, readers can refer to Pearsall (2015, pp. 41–42). Charred seeds lose their original colour (turning black), but mostly retain their morphology although slightly changing their dimension. The chance of preservation is particularly high considering that charred material is not attacked by bacteria or fungi (Weiss and Kislev, 2007).\n\n\n3.2.1.2.2 Mineralisation\nMineralisation is a natural process that leads to the replacement of organic material with inorganic material. Through phosphatisation, soft tissue is replaced by calcium-phosphate minerals that preserve the morphology of the seed (Murphy, 2014). Mineralisation can also occur because some plants are particularly mineral-rich, and the phenomenon takes place prior to deposition. This is known as biomineralisation (Messager et al., 2010). For instance, mineralised seeds can be found in latrines or cesspits (Veen et al., 2013, p. 164)\n\n\n3.2.1.2.3 Waterlogging\nOrganic material maintained in a wet environment under very low oxygen levels (anaerobic conditions) can be preserved as the activity of micro-organism is low or entirely absent. Examples of wet environments include natural ones (lake, riverine, marine sediments, marshes, bogs, etc.) or man-made (pits, latrines, wells, ditches, etc.) (Spriggs, 2014). Waterlogged seeds do not degrade markedly, but their starch, sugar and protein content is low and their colour is dark (Weiss and Kislev, 2007).\n\n\n3.2.1.2.4 Desiccation\nThis phenomenon is limited to very arid regions (mostly Egypt, some areas of China and Spain), where the complete desiccation of the organic material prevents microbial decay. Where plant material is preserved through drying, the preservation is remarkable; for instance, even aDNA survives in desiccated seeds (Veen, 2018, p. 58).\n\n\n3.2.1.2.5 Metal oxidation\nPlant material can be preserved if found in proximity to metals. Metal oxides when the soil is moist, creating a toxic environment for microbial activity.\n\n\n3.2.1.2.6 Ceramic imprints\nThe imprints of seeds and plants on the wet clay can help the investigator recognise the morphology of the seed and identify the plant, however the organic material is not preserved and the marks on the pottery are the only visible remains (Schepers and Vries, 2022).\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Microremains: palinology\nPalynology deals with the study of pollen grains and spores. The former are produced by seed plants, angiosperms and gymnosperms, and are not visible to the naked eye; hence, magnification is required (Bennett and Willis, 2002). The grains are formed in the anther, and are used to transport the male cells to the pistil of another flower to fertilise the female eggs (pollination) (Bakels, 2020). The discipline of palynology also studies spores, micro-particles originating from fungi and algae. Prior to their deposition, pollen grains are transported in the air by wind, insects, bats and some bird species. At some point, the grains fall to the earth’s surface or in water. The phenomenon is known as “pollen rain”, and the accumulation of pollen deposited in a location can represent to a certain degree the collective environment that produced the sediment. Palinologists usually distinguish between off- and on- site pollen. Off-site pollen is collected from permanently waterlogged contexts as lake bottoms, bogs, etc. This approach is particularly recommended for climatic and palaeoenvironmental reconstructions, as pollen and spores are deposited and permanently sealed. On-site pollen is collected from archaeological layers and the nature of its deposit is much different than off-site samples (Bennett and Willis, 2002; Pearsall, 2015). Anna Maria Mercuri (2014) reports that:\n\nPeople and animals transported plant parts into the site through plant harvesting, on feet and skins, or by coprolites. Pollen accumulation was, thus, mainly the ‘result of human action’ and a true imprint of human behaviour.\n\nOff- and on- site pollen answer then different questions. If the former allows the archaeologist to draw inferences about past vegetation and land use, the latter are much more site-specific and provide us with more information about the plants in the immediate proximity of the site. An agricultural historical analysis of a single site would therefore be more appropriate with pollen collected on-site, however taking into account that the deposition of pollen grains can be the result of human and animal mobility (Mercuri, 2014) or imports (Bakels, 2020, p. 205). A correct environmental reconstruction of the area surrounding an archaeological site must then always consider more factors, such as combining pollen data with carpological data.\n\n3.2.2.1 Sampling and preservation\nPollen can be sampled from permanently wet sediments including—river beds, lake bottoms, peats, ponds. The catchment area of the resulting pollen diagram depends on the sampling location. The catchment area of samples from a lake bottom is wider in range, whereas a small pond has a relatively restricted range. In the latter case, it would be more appropriate to sample several locations to reconstruct the palaeo-vegetation of a region, provided the necessary funds and resources are available. In any case, almost 99% of pollen is deposited within 1 km of the original source (Armstrong and Brasier, 2005). In rare circumstances, it is also possible to sample from dry contexts as colluvia layers and buried soils. A colluvium layer is a superficial deposit produced by meteoric erosion on topographic slopes (Parry, 2011). Although not usually preserved in dry buried soils, pollen grains can be found in particular conditions, as in very acidic soils, where the microbial activity is very low. Other factors leading to pollen being preserved in dry soils are not entirely known in detail yet (Bakels, 2020, p. 215; Moore et al., 1991). The sampling locations mentioned above are off-site locations. On-site locations are mostly waterlogged archaeological contexts, such as—moats, wells, and cesspits. This type of deposit is not suitable for environmental reconstructions, as it tells about local dynamics and human behaviour. The collection of pollen samples must be accurate, because the risk of contamination with upper or lower layers is high. For this reason, it is essential to avoid layers that have been in direct contact with air. There are several techniques for collecting samples, in most cases a section is sampled to obtain a pollen diagram. Sections are sampled using zinc tins that are hammered into the section. The height of the stratigraphical layers are marked on the back of the tin, which is later sealed with plastic foil and stored. When sampling a section is not possible, samples can also be obtained through cores, continuous sections of sediment stored in a plastic cylinder. The coring process is described more in detail in Stein (1986). Although being more resistant to decay than seeds, thanks to an outer protective layer (the exine), pollen too is not exempt from preservation biases. Some types of pollen are not preserved at all, some decay faster and others last longer. Common causes of deterioration include—corrosion of the pollen exine (the outermost protective layer of the pollen grain) from biochemical oxidation, degradation from chemical oxidation in aerial and subaerial environments, mechanical damage (e.g. breaking of the pollen grain), and mineral deposition (Jones et al., 2007). Another source of bias is taxonomic under- or over- representation. Pollens that have a slow decay rate tend to be overrepresented, for instance in the case of the Asteraceae. Other sources of bias are represented by differences in pollen production of individual taxa. Plants that rely on animal pollination produce less pollen than plants that can only rely on wind transportation. Light exposure also contributes to the amount of pollen produced by plants (Bakels, 2020). Cereals are likely to be under-represented in pollen spectra as their contribution to the pollen rain is limited—the largeness of the pollen grains (> 0.40 μm) prevents them to be transported far from the wind as they fall to the ground. Even ancient and wild wheats such as emmer (Triticum dicoccum), which Johannes Iversen (1973) hypothesised were cross-fertilizing and releasing more pollen into the wind than modern self-pollinating wheats (i.e. bread wheat), seem to contribute only marginally to the pollen spectra (Bottema, 1992). One notable exception is rye (Secale cereale), a cross-pollinating plant, which produces a large amount of pollen grains (Piotrowska, 2012). For the reasons stated above, the situation illustrated by pollen diagrams does not entirely match to the reality of past environments. Several experiments with modern pollen have been conducted to attempt to correct these biasing factors using software and statistical approaches (Mehl and Hjelle, 2015; Middleton and Bunting, 2004; Sugita, 2013)."

    "text": "6.2 Statistical computing\nStatistical computing, often referred to as computational statistics, is a branch of statistics that uses computational approaches to solving statistical problems. Traditionally, the term statistical computing places more emphasis on numerical methods, while computational statistics refer to topics such as resampling methods, exploratory data analysis, neural networks, etc. (Rizzo, 2019). Specifically, computational statistics deals with methods “unthinkable before the computer age” (Lauro, 1996). In Archaeology, mainly two programming languages are used today for exploring large sets of data: R and Python. Both programming languages can be used for statistical modeling, although R was designed explicitly for statistical computing and Python as an object-oriented language for more general purposes. Python is one of the most used and fastest-growing programming languages in the world, and its package number is extremely high compared to R. While R benefits from a strong academic community, Python relies on developers to add new packages almost continuously. R was used for the majority of this project due to its familiarity, while Python was used for certain algorithms that were easier to implement.\n\n\n\nLogos of R and Python\n\n\n\n6.2.1 The R programming language\nR, as described on the R-Project FAQs is a “system for statistical computation and graphics. It consists of a language plus a run-time environment with graphics, a debugger, access to certain system functions, and the ability to run programs stored in script files”. Increasingly popular for data scientists, R is based on S and provides its own IDE (the R GUI), although RStudio1 is the most popular IDE for computing the R language. For this project, RStudio was the standard IDE.\n\n6.2.1.1 R Packages\nIn addition to base R, several packages enhance its performances and offer more tools to users. The packages are distributed by the official CRAN repository, which counts more than 18,452 packages2.\n\n6.2.1.1.1 tidyverse\nThe tidyverse ecosystem (Wickham et al., 2019) is a core set of packages for R, maintained by Hadley Wickham for importing, tidying, transforming and visualising data which includes packages such as—ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, stringr, tibble, forcats, purr, readr.\n\n\n6.2.1.1.2 ggplot2\nggplot2 is the most common data visualisation package for R, included in the tidyverse environment. The package substitutes the R base graphics and allows visualisation of single and multiple components (Wickham, 2016).\n\n\n6.2.1.1.3 knitr\nThe knitr engine enables the integration of R with HTML, Markdown and LaTeX. The package allows reproducible research (Xie, 2021) and was used for generating dynamic reports and documentation for this thesis.\n\n\n6.2.1.1.4 vegan\nThe vegan package (Oksanen et al., 2022) is designed for ordination methods, diversity analysis and multivariate analysis in ecology.\n\n\n\n\n6.2.2 The Python programming language\nPython is a popular high-level general-purpose programming language that supports object-oriented, procedural and functional programming. Several IDE support Python, including JupyterLab (open source), RStudio, PyCharm and Visual Studio Code. In recent years, many statistical packages have been developed to compete with R in the data science field. This project uses Python in addition to R as its environment offers well-designed and intuitive packages for some of the data-reduction methods used on the datasets.\n\n6.2.2.1 Python packages\nPython’s motto “batteries included” refers to its comprehensive standard library. However, over 390,000 packages are contained in the PyPi repository providing users with many options for coding. In particular, this project uses some data science libraries (set of packages) and packages listed below.\n\n6.2.2.1.1 Pandas\nPandas is the most used package for data handling, manipulation and analysis (Reback et al., 2022).\n\n\n6.2.2.1.2 Matplotlib\nMatplotlib is Python’s standard data visualisation library (Hunter, 2007).\n\n\n6.2.2.1.3 Seaborn\nBased on Matplotlib, Seaborn is a data visualisation library that allows users to create more complex graphs (Waskom, 2021).\n\n\n6.2.2.1.4 Scikit-learn\nScikit-learn is the most comprehensive Python library for machine learning, including methods for classification, clustering, data reduction and regression (Pedregosa et al., 2011).\n\n\n6.2.2.1.5 NumPy\nThe NumPy library is the main tool for array programming and it includes several functions for numerical analysis (Harris et al., 2020).\n\n\n6.2.2.1.6 SciPy\nThe SciPy library provides tools for scientific computing (data integration, interpolation, optimization, linear algebra, etc.) and it works with NumPy multidimensional arrays (Virtanen et al., 2020)."

    "text": "5.4 Database\n\n5.4.1 What is a database?\nDatabases are increasingly being used in archaeology to archive and collect data digitally. There are mainly two types of databases—relational and non-relational. A relational database is more appropriate for well-defined data structures which can be linked through a mutual attribute. It is built and maintained with Structured Query Language (SQL), which allows the user to interrogate the database through queries (Gattiglia, 2018). A SQL database consists of several tables containing information in columns (variables) and rows (entries). Each row is defined by an unique key. Examples of relational database management systems include—MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle Database. A non-relational database (NoSQL) is advantageous in the case of unstructured data, as data is archived as a single document rather than in a table. This structure allows much more flexibility, although NoSQL databases can be harder to use by non-specialists. Among the NoSQL database management systems, MongoDB is the most widely used.\n\n\n5.4.2 Databases in archaeology\nDatabases are used in archaeology primarily for two reasons—data management and data sharing. Most excavations are now working with databases, where the information concerning each stratigraphic unit and finds is recorded. Databases can also be linked and interact with Geographical Information Systems (GIS), that allow researchers to work with a spatial component. In many cases, this data remains private, even after the publication of the excavation results, although increasingly more teams are also making their data available to the public. The growing popularity of open data has also created the need for standardisation. Since the 1970s, researchers started working on thesauri (Figuera, 2018), dictionaries and guides for the correct archival of archaeological information (e.g. pottery classes, context types, chronologies, etc.). A shared system of naming practices is essential for sharing, integrating and analysing data. Recently, more standardised databases and repositories are being created and openly published:\n\nArchaeological Data Service (ADS). A non-profit organisation, based at the University of York. The website provides a large repository of downloadable archaeological data (mostly from the British isles) (Richards, 2021).\nARIADNEplus, a Horizon 2020 project funded by the European Commission aiming to build an integrated european archaeological data structure. Over 2 million datasets are part of this project, with the original data still managed by the original creators (Niccolucci, 2020).\n\nMost of the archaeological databases are based on SQL, as the visual relationships between different data structures are easier to understand.\n\n\n5.4.3 Creating an Environmental Archaeology database\nAn integrated database with environmental archaeology data is still missing in Italy. A first step towards botanical data digitalisation has been the BRAIN project (Botanical Records of Archaeobotany Italian Network), a census of the Italian excavations that reported archaeobotanical data (Mercuri et al., 2015). The website, although not providing raw data, has been useful to the bibliographical research for this project. For what concerns faunal remains, a database is missing, although a pilot project was started at the University of Siena by Boscato et al. (2007). The database was created using FileMaker Pro and was likely never published.\nFor the scope of this project, it was thus necessary to create a database that contained raw environmental data. The creation of a database for this research responded to the need of a systematic approach in storing environmental data in a common format and in a way that is convenient for querying, rather than merely archiving the information. The goal is to have data readily available for exploratory data analysis, in an automated process that does not require to adapt the query and manually wrangle data each time a new sample is added to the collection. This project uses MariaDB, a fast and stable fork of MySQL.\nThe database was structured with the creation of 21 tables. The table site_list is the core table, from which most of the other tables in the schema depend. The entries in the table are based on the chronology of a single sample. The chronology is defined both by the macroperiod3 and by the centuries, with two columns: startcentury and endcentury. If a context has been sampled more than once, there will be as many entries as many chronologies. If a context has been sampled both for seeds and bones, the sample IDs will be recorded on the same entry (if the chronologies match).\n\n\n\nContext\nSample #ID\n\n\n\n\nImola, villa Clelia, 6th c.\n15\n\n\nImola, villa Clelia, 10th-11th c.\n16\n\n\n\nSince the table is context based, each site has been provided with an unique ID, so that if the site has been sampled in different areas the database can be still queried using the site ID4. In addition to the reference to the samples table, the table site_list also contains references to child tables with information about: site type, geography, altitude, coordinates, and region. The samples are organized in three tables, depending on the type of remain that has to be recorded in the database:\n\nplant_remains\npollen_remains\nfaunal_remains\n\nEach entry in the samples tables contains information about chronology, sampling type and notes, reference to the publication, reference to the main site, and the raw data. The tables faunal_chrono_weights and plants_chrono_weights contain the automated calculation of the samples weights (refer to Section 5.5.1). The Figure 5.1 shows the schema with the complete list of tables in the database.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Schema of the database, with the table site_list at the core.\n\n\nThe data was stored in the database after a thorough bibliographical research of the excavated sites (with a chronology pertaining to the 1st millennium CE) where environmental analyses have been undertaken. As in most of the cases the material was retrieved from physical publications, not digitised, the process of data entry was manual and could not be automatised. A list of the publication types where data was retrieved from can be visualised in Figure 5.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Count of the publication types in the database."

    "text": "6.4 Periodization\nSome of the statistics performed on the dataset have been based on sample periodization, from the Roman age to the Medieval age. The chronologies have been defined as follows:\n\n[R] Roman: from the 1st century BCE to the 2nd century CE.\n[LR] Late Roman: from the 3rd to the 5th century CE.\n[EMA] Early Middle Ages: from the 6th to the 10th century CE.\n[Ma] Middle Ages: from the 11th century CE onwards.\n\nIn the database, the tables faunal_chronologies and plants_chronologies connect each bioarchaeological sample to another table with the identification numbers for the periods (e.g. Sample 1 = ID 1). If a sample has a chronology ranging between two periods, two separate entries will be recorded on the database (e.g. Sample 1 – 2nd to 3rd c. CE = Periods: Roman, Late Roman) with the result of the sample being repeated in both periods.\n\n\n\nPeriodization schema.\n\n\n\n6.4.1 Chronological fuzziness\nOne of the methodological issues affecting this project is that of chronological fuzziness. Dating plant and animal remains using radiocarbon is very rare, at least in the samples recorded in the database. Most of these samples are dated using ceramics, and chronologies can range between one century or several. Taking this into account, I weighted each sample as follows: \\[ W=\\frac{1}{(C_{end}-C_{start}+1)} \\] Where:\n\n\\(C\\_{end}\\) is the terminus ante quem.\n\\(C\\_{start}\\) is the terminus post quem.\n1 has been summed to the denominator to avoid 0 values.\n\nThe imported tables already contain a column of weights, as this operation has been performed on the database prior the export. A diachronic table of means for both datasets has been generated using the functions:\n\nzooarch_tables (custom)\nBot_mean_table (custom)\nBot_mean_fun (custom)\nweightedMedian (from the package matrixStats)\n\nThe weight can be used for weighted means and medians, with samples with larger chronologies (hence less precise/fuzzy) weighting less. This method provides each sample with a weight proportional to the length of its chronology so that lower weight values have a smaller impact on the computations."

    "text": "6.6 Multivariate statistics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection in progress\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis research uses multivariate analysis to explore possible relationships within the sets of environmental data under investigation. Univariate analyses can be easily plotted and visualized with bar charts, histograms and density curves. A scatterplot (or scattergram) shows the relationship between two variables by plotting their values on the axes of a diagram using Cartesian coordinates. This relationship can also be mathematically measured by calculating a distance between two points in the graph. However, the relationship between more than two variables is much harder to read on a scatterplot, as it would require as many axes as the number of variables. If our analysis is exploratory, we might not know yet where to look for correlations. A possible solution is analysing each combination of two variables in the dataset and measure their correlation. This would require too much computation time if the dataset had a large number of variables, that is to say if we are dealing with big data. In addition, we would only gather information about the relationship between two variables, when there might be another factor influencing a trend or phenomenon. Multivariate statistics has a wide range of applications, including grouping and multidimensional scaling, as well as in machine learning and predictive analysis [Fletcher and Lock (2005)). In this research, multivariate methods have been applied both to the botanical and faunal datasets, mainly with the objective of (i) testing hypotheses between multiple variables and (ii) reducing the dimensionality of data to—assess which variables are the main drivers of change in the datasets and examine relationships between these variables.\n\n6.6.1 Statistical hypothesis testing\nExplain what is hypothesis testing\n\n6.6.1.1 PERMANOVA\nPermutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) is a non-parametric multivariate statistical test used to compare group of objects. By using measure space, the null hypothesis that the centroids and dispersion of groups are identical is tested. The null hypothesis is rejected if either the centroid or the spread of the objects differs between the groups. A prior calculation of the distance between any two objects included in the experiment is used to determine whether the test is valid or not. [Anderson (2017).\n\n\n\n6.6.2 Dimensionality reduction and ordination\nDimensionality reduction techniques transform high-dimension datasets into a low-dimension ordination space, with the intention of maintaining the geometry and data structure as close as possible to the original dataset. The dimension of a dataset is given by the number of variables (i.e. the columns in the table). As anticipated in Section 6.6, as each variable is graphically represented by an axis, it would be virtually impossible to represent more than three axes in a graph. Ordination allows to reduce data dimensionality to usually one to three (at most) dimensions. Moreover, focusing on a reduced number of dimensions reduces the amount of “noise” that can mislead the interpretation (Gauch, 1982). The points generated through ordination techniques (the objects in our dataset) can eventually be plotted in a scatterplot. In most of the ordination methods, points plotting closer together in graph are more similar, whereas points far apart from each other are more dissimilar (Shennan, 1997, p. 197). For instance, one could perform an ordination on a group of burials in a cemetery where each point represents a single burial assemblage. After the ordination it is also possible to group the new reduced set of variables, to observe differences between groups and facilitate the interpretation. In the previous example, a group might be represented by burials of the same ethnic group, status, etc.\nMany of the ordination techniques described in this chapter developed in fields outside archaeology, and are thus borrowed from disciplines as community ecology. Ecologists regularly apply ordination methods for the study of environmental gradients, so that the term “gradient analysis” is often used interchangeably with “ordination”. An environmental gradient refers to variations in site characteristics (e.g. time, elevation, temperature, vegetation, etc.), which in turn can affect biotic factors (e.g. species abundance, diversity, etc.) (Grebner et al., 2013). The purpose of ordination is then to identify the cause of ecological processes in the dataset. Generally, it is possible to apply ordination on datasets in which the variables have a cause-and-effect (e.g. climate vs. plant species) or mutual influences on each other. There are two main types of ordination, or gradient analysis, techniques (see Table 6.1): direct (constrained) or indirect (unconstrained). The objective of indirect (unconstrained) gradient analysis is to identify patterns between samples of ‘dependent variables’ (e.g. which sites are more similar according to their species composition). Conversely, direct gradient (or constrained) analysis includes more information (or tables) in a single analysis—the dependent variables are now constrained to be a function of other sets of ‘independent variables’ (usually environmental proxies). In short, a constrained analysis uses both datasets to find the best possible mathematical relationship between the dependent and independent variables. In this sense, direct gradient analysis can be considered as an extension of unconstrained analysis (Syms, 2008). The choice between using constrained or unconstrained methods for ordination strictly depends on the research questions and on the researcher’s dataset.\n\n\nTable 6.1: Ordination methods used in gradient analysis.

The analysis of eigenvalues and eigenvectors will not be described in detail in this chapter, and the meaning of the terms will be only briefly explained in the text. However, some information must be given for the eigenanalysis-based ordination methods:\n\nThe methods are performed on a square symmetric matrix (for instance a correlation matrix);\nThe order of the variables is not important for the result;\nAxes are ranked according to their eigenvalues (i.e. the first axis has the largest eigenvalue, the second the second-largest, etc.)\nEigenvalues have mathematical meaning that is important for the interpretation of our data.\n\n\n\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) is an useful tool to identify possible patterns or sub-groups in data. The input variables in the dataset must be numerical (or at least dichotomous). If used for machine learning, PCA is in fact an unsupervised method, meaning that the data points will be unlabelled after the transformation. As for other dimensionality reduction methods, the algorithm tries to preserve the global structure of data by finding a space in which dimensions can be reduced without losing much information. In other words, PCA optimizes the loss of variance. The first step in PCA is creating a correlation matrix or covariance matrix, to extract the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The decision between correlation or covariance matrix depends on our data and on our research questions. Correlation matrices are helpful if our variables have different units (e.g. lenght, volume, etc.). Covariance matrices can be used if the variables have the same unit and comparable variances. The latter is an important factor to consider before choosing covariance matrices, as the biggest variances will overshadow the others (Carlson, 2017, p. 267). For PCA, the eigenvalues are the variances of the principal components (so that the first component has the largest eigenvalue) and the eigenvectors are the principal component loadings (the score for each variable in the new dimensional space). After extracting the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, the user must decide how many components he will use. The components (defined as the sum in % of the eigenvalues) are the axes in our new dimensional space. Most of the times, the first two components are enough to explain the variance in our dataset. For instance, if the first two axes explain 80% and 12% of the variance, it is acceptable to use a 2D graph—the graphical representation of the two axes will explain 92% of the variance. It is possible to choose the appropriate number of components by using a scree plot, which shows the amount of variance for each component. Scree plots are an important of PCA, because they allow us to see how many components have a significant variance (eigenvalue). A significant variance must be greater than 1. If more than 2 or 3 components have a variance greater than 1, PCA might not be the best method for reducing our set of data. The example in Figure 6.1 shows that PCA in this case is an appropriate method, as only the first two components have variances greater than 1. Therefore we can discard the other components as they are of little significance.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Example of a scree plot showing that only the first two components have a variance greater than 1. Figure after Carlson (2017, p. 271)\n\n\nMost of the statistical packages offer an automatic rotation of the axes for an easier interpretation of the results, which is more important if the data has been standardised prior to the calculations.\n\n6.6.2.1.1 Interpreting a PCA\nPCA are often visualised through biplots, which shows at the same time the scores of the observations (rows) and the loadings of the variables (columns). Generally, the x-axis of the plot represents the first component, and the y-axis the second component. Making sense of the plotted observations is straightforward—points that are closer together are more similar and they can create clusters. It is important to remember that first component of the PCA lays on the x-axis, so differences in clusters on the first component (i.e. the horizontal distance) is actually larger than differences in clusters on the second component (i.e. the vertical distance). Interpreting the variable loadings can be more difficult. The variables are represented by arrows, implying that the variable increases in the direction of the arrow and decreases in the opposite direction. The direction of the arrow is given by the loadings of the first component—if the loadings are negative the arrows will point to the left. If the signs of the loadings are flipped the result will be the same but the arrows will point towards opposite directions. The arrows show how strongly each variable influences a principal component, with longer arrows being the best described in the dimension. The angle between the arrows also indicate extra information useful for the interpretation:\n\nIf two arrows form a small angle, the two variables are positively correlated.\nIf two arrows form a large diverging angle, the two variables are negatively correlated.\nIf two arrows form an angle close to 90°, there might be no correlation at all.\n\nFigure 6.2 shows an example of a PCA biplot. All the arrows (variables) point to the same direction, but we can interpret their correlations using the angles as described above. For example, B1 and B2 are not correlated, as they form an angle of 90°. On the contrary, the variables B and L are positively correlated, as they form a very small angle.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: PCA Biplot, after Carlson (2017, p. 274)\n\n\n\n\n\n6.6.2.2 CA\nCorrespondence analysis (CA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that can be applied to contingency tables. Contingency tables (or crosstabs) are two-way tables used to display frequency data formed by two categorical variables. In some ways, correspondence analysis is similar to PCA, being an indirect gradient analysis3 used to summarize categorical variables. As opposed to maximising the variance, CA maximises the degree of correspondence between rows and columns (i.e. observations and variables). The distance matrix used to perform the analysis is obtained from the chi-square distance between the rows and columns profiles. This is a modification of the chi-square statistic for hypothesis testing (Tallarida and Murray, 1987). An in-depth technical and methodological breakdown of correspondence analysis is beyond the scope of this text, and readers can refer to Greenacre (2021). As in PCA, the analysis generates—eigenvalues, row coordinates (scores), and column coordinates (loadings). An important distinction must be made with PCA with regard to eigenvalues. In PCA, eigenvalues refer to the ‘variation explained’. Conversely, in CA eigenvalues represent the inertia, the correlation coefficient between rows and columns (i.e. how well does the row correspond to the column?).\nCorrespondence analysis is appropriate for exploring non-negative data (e.g. relative abundance, counts, presence/absence) in a contingency table, and examining the relationships between cells in a row, in a column, and their interrelationship (Baxter, 2015, p. 101). On a practical level, CA can be used to compare assemblages from different sites, to answer questions such as “which sites do certain finds correspond to?” or “which sites are more similar according to their assemblages?”. This technique is extremely useful for archaeologists, even though its reception by the archaeological community has been slow. CA has been used by archaeologists since the mid-70s in France, although the technique was only introduced to the English-speaking audience in the 80s with a paper by Bølviken et al. (1982), and became more popular in the 90s (Baxter, 2015; Baxter and Cool, 2010). One of the biggest drawbacks of CA is its sensitivity to outliers (values that are either much bigger or much smaller when compared to the others in the table). Some of the samples used in this project suffer from this problem, and the causes of outliers will be discussed in more detail later in this text4. The algorithm tends to place larger abundances towards the centre of the diagonal, and small or zero values away from the diagonal—it is indeed a bad idea to use CA with tables containing outliers. Outliers represent a major problem in CA, as their presence will determine the scale of the biplot, thus clustering the other points closer together, and perhaps obscuring some of the patterns we are interested in finding. In this eventuality, these points might be poorly ordinated. A possible way to overcome this issue would be to check whether the other dimensions are more appropriate for the representation, even though the sensible thing to do would be to remove these outliers from the original contingency table and to study them separately. Practical examples of outliers are rare species, for instance rows with a few non-zero values. Rare species should not be studied with CA, unless the table only contains rare species, with comparable values. As Baxter and Cool (2010, p. 225) note, we should not regard this omission as “subjective and unjustified data manipulation”—there are other ways to visualise outliers along with the rest of our data, for instance boxplots.\nIn R, common implementations of correspondence analysis are included in the packages MASS, FactoMineR and vegan. CA has been used several times in this research using the function cca() from the vegan package, which was applied to the presence/absence archaeobotanical dataset (**add where else**5). The function cca() performs a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), but it can also be used for correspondence analysis.\n\n6.6.2.2.1 Interpreting a CA\nCorrespondence analyses are also visualised through biplots. As in PCA, the horizontal axis represents most of the variance, and the vertical axis is the second most representative dimension. A classic example for understanding and interpreting CA comes from a survey on the smoking habits of 193 employees in a fictitious company (Table 6.2). The staff members are categorised according to their position in the company (rows) and smoking habits (columns).\n\n\nTable 6.2: Smoking habits of staff groups, example after Greenacre (1984).\n\n\nStaff\nNone\nLight\nMedium\nHeavy\n\n\n\n\nSenior Manager (SM)\n4\n2\n3\n2\n\n\nJunior Manager (JM)\n4\n3\n7\n4\n\n\nSenior Employee (SE)\n25\n10\n12\n4\n\n\nJunior Employee (JE)\n18\n24\n33\n13\n\n\nSecretaries (SC)\n10\n6\n7\n2\n\n\n\n\nThe technical details of how the algorithm computes scores for this dataset are described in Greenacre (2021, pp. 65–72). After computing the CA, it is possible to visualise the biplot. In Figure 6.3, the x-axis explains 87.8% of the variance, and the y-axis 11.8%. Together, they explain 99.6% of the total variance in the dataset, an optimal representation of the dataset. Much of the variance is explained by the first component (x-axis), and the horizontal distance between points is thus much more important than the vertical distance (on the y-axis).\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: Correspondence analysis performed on Table 6.2, image after Greenacre (2021, p. 67).\n\n\nA scree plot can be helpful to evaluate the number of dimensions to choose, representing eigenvalues (or variances) from the largest to the smallest. The number of dimensions should be chosen by looking at where the scree plot starts to bend and the eigenvalues start to become small. An example of a scree plot has already been provided in Figure 6.1. The biplot contains points both for rows and columns. As the distances between points are chi-squared distances, for the interpretation of the results row points closer together are more similar, and the same logic applies to column points. However, one should be careful when interpreting distances between row and column points. The way to interpret their correlation is similar to the PCA:\n\nIf angle formed by the lines connecting the row and column labels to the origin is small, the association is strong.\nIf the angle is 90°, there is no association.\nIf the angle is near 180°, the association is negative.\n\nIn addition to what already mentioned, it is important to remember that points away from the origin and the edges are the most informative, as they might represent a better ordination.\nReturning to the interpretation of the CA in Figure 6.3, from the example concerning the smoking habits of the staff members in a company, it is easy to see how the smoking categories (on the left) are separated from the non-smokers (on the right). The groups that display the biggest separation are Junior Employee-Junior Manager, against Senior Employee. Secretaries are closer to Senior Employees. On the vertical axis, it is possible to see how Junior Employees are relatively more light smokers when compared to Junior Managers.\n\n\n\n6.6.2.3 nMDS\nMultidimensional scaling (MDS) is a technique to visualise the level of similarity of individual observations (e.g. sites/cases) in a dataset. MDS works with matrices containing Euclidean distances between each pair of observations. Conversely, non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) is a rank-based approach that finds both:\n\nA non-parametric monotonic relationship between the items in the dissimilarity matrix and the Euclidean distances.\nThe location of items in the low-dimensional space.\n\nThe goal of nMDS is to represent the pairwise dissimilarity between items in the matrix as closely as possible. For this reason, it is considered as a good technique for multivariate data visualisation. nMDS can be used on quantitative, qualitative and mixed data. For this project, it has been applied to a subset of the early medieval archaeobotanical dataset that included presence/absence values of cereals. The full breakdown of the process is reported in Section 7.4.2. The R function metaMDS from the package vegan allows users to select the distance metric most appropriate to their data (e.g. Bray-Curtis, Jaccard, etc.). As nMDS is an iterative approach, meaning that the the computations are run until the best solution is found, it can be quite computationally demanding for larger datasets. Although the nMDS algorithm tries to minimize the ordination stress, it is a good practice to compute the ordination stress value to judge the reliability of the solution found (goodness-of-fit). Ordination stress indicates how much distorted are the fitted data when compared to the original observed samples. Stress values can also be visualised with the function stressplot() (vegan package), which produces a Shepard stressplot (Figure 6.4).\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: A Shepard plot, from R Studio Pubs.\n\n\nThe Shepard plot displays the ordination distance against the observed distance. Ideally, the higher the points should fall on a monotonic line, where an increased observed distance is related to an increased ordination distance. Moreover, the higher the number of dimensions, the lower the stress value. If interested in choosing the appropriate number of dimensions, it is possible to use a scree plot which shows the number of dimensions against the stress level. Generally, it is possible to interpret stress values following these guidelines (Dexter et al., 2018):\n\n\nTable 6.3: Ordination stress for the interpretation of nMDS\n\n\nInterpretation\nStress level\n\n\n\n\nExcellent\n< 0.05\n\n\nGood\n< 0.1\n\n\nUsable (but caution is required)\n> 0.2\n\n\nRandom\n> 0.3\n\n\n\n\nIf the solution has produced a good stress level for the number of dimensions required, it is possible to plot the nMDS and interpret the results. Points that plot closer together are more similar, while points that are distant one to each other are more different. The nMDS plot can also be useful in recognizing groups (points grouping together and plotting further from other points). An example is provided in Figure 6.5.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.5: A nMDS plot with clusters, from R Studio Pubs.\n\n\n\n\n6.6.2.4 NCA\nThe Neighborhood Component Analysis is a supervised machine learning algorithm for metric learning, developed by Goldberger et al. (2005) at the University of Toronto. The documentation for the Python implementation (package sklearn.neighbors) reports that:\n\nIt learns a linear transformation in a supervised fashion to improve the classification accuracy of a stochastic nearest neighbours rule in the transformed space.\n\nThe algorithm optimizes the overall classification accuracy of multivariate data, and it works in a similar way to the \\(k\\)-Nearest Neighbours (\\(k\\)-NN). NCA is mostly used for distance metric learning, although it can be used as a linear dimensionality reduction technique. Both \\(k\\)-NN and NCA can be applied to non-normal distributions, as they are non-parametric methods (Cardarelli, 2022).\nIn this project, NCA has been applied to the same subset used for the nMDS (which included presence/absence values of cereals), with the scope of dimensionality reduction. The dataset has been reduced to one dimension to show a greater degree of separation between Northern and Southern Italy in the early Middle Ages. The entire process of data preparation and processing is described in ?sec-NCA-Cereals."

    "text": "4.7 Archaeobotany\nThe objective of archaeobotany is to recover, identify, and document plant remains from archaeological sites to reconstruct past vegetation dynamics, human-environment interactions, and food production and consumption patterns. Archaeobotany can also be referred to as “palaeoethnobotany”, a term especially prevalent in North America. Although the word “palaeoethnobotany” places a stronger stress on the human and ethnic interaction with plants (Hastorf and Popper, 1988), the two words are used mostly interchangeably (Hastorf, 1999) as European archaeobotanists share the same objectives. It is important to emphasise that the term “palaeobotany” is not a valid synonym for archaeobotany, as it refers to the study of past evolution and adaptations of plants, and this discipline is not concerned with human-environment interactions (Fuller and Lucas, 2014). In Classical archaeology, some of the archaeobotanical research questions can also be inferred from historical literature. This is problematic, as the evidence often contradicts what is said in texts; Pearsall (2015, p. 27) remarks how the discipline works using an archaeological approach, not an historical one. Furthermore, the domain of archaeology stretches far beyond the chronological range of textual history. In the archaeological record, four types of botanical remains can be identified—macroremains, pollen grains, phytoliths, and starches (Pearsall, 2015). Macroremains such as seeds, nutshells, fruit pips, and charcoal (wood preserved after carbonisation) are visible to the naked eye (> 0.25 mm). Pollen grains are produced by angiosperm and gymnosperm plants in the male portion of the flower and are not visible to the naked eye; hence, magnification is required (Bennett and Willis, 2002). In addition to pollen, other microfossils include phytoliths (inorganic elements found in leaves, stems, and other parts of plants) and starch granules (formed by amylose or amylopectin polymer aggregates). As most archaeobotanical studies in Italy deal with macroremains and pollen, this research will only focus on these remains. The conditions under which such remains are preserved in archaeological records are discussed later.\n\n4.7.1 Preservation\nArchaeobotany focuses on the study of plant remains preserved in archaeological sites, thus it is important to know the conditions under which organic material was preserved in stratigraphic levels. Macro- and micro- remains can be preserved under different conditions, which will be listed below.\n\n4.7.1.1 Macroremains\nThere are several ways in which seeds can be preserved, among them charring (or carbonisation), mineralisation, waterlogging, desiccation, metal oxide preservation and as imprints in ceramics (Fuller and Lucas, 2014). This section will focus only on grain preservation, excluding wood remains, as anthracological data (charred wood) has not been recorded on the database. The mode of preservation has a strong effect on the species of plants that can be found in the archaeological level. Cereals and nuts have higher chances of being preserved by charring, while fruit pips, herbs and spices are most common in waterlogged sediments. Nuts, fibrous and oil-rich plants are also equally preserved under water. Desiccation greatly preserves several parts of a plant, although it occurs very rarely (Veen, 2018, p. 71). These factors influence the representation of plants in the archaeological context, and one must be aware that the most identified taxa may represent the plants that had the best chance of being preserved. The most represented taxa therefore do not necessarily coincide with the most numerous or used plants at the site being investigated (Pearsall, 2015, p. 42). Figure 4.8 and Figure 4.9 show how different preservation methods affect the representation of a taxon.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.8: Preservation mode of species with more than five occurrences in northwestern Europe in the Roman period [c= charred, m = mineralised, w = waterlogged, u = unknown]. Image after Livarda (2018).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.9: Preservation mode of three plant groups in medieval Britain [black = charred, white = waterlogged, grey = mineralised]. Image after Veen et al. (2013).\n\n\n\n4.7.1.1.1 Charring\nCarbonisation is the most common way of finding seeds when excavating an archaeological site, most notably when using flotation on the samples. Carbonisation occurs when seeds (or other botanical materials) are exposed to fire at not excessively high temperatures and under anaerobic conditions so that the combustion process is not completed. Several experiments have been carried out to understand the way in which carbonisation takes place and for a review of the literature on this topic, readers can refer to Pearsall (2015, pp. 41–42). Charred seeds lose their original colour (turning black), but mostly retain their morphology although slightly changing their dimension. The chance of preservation is particularly high considering that charred material is not attacked by bacteria or fungi (Weiss and Kislev, 2007).\n\n\n4.7.1.1.2 Mineralisation\nMineralisation is a natural process that leads to the replacement of organic material with inorganic material. Through phosphatisation, soft tissue is replaced by calcium-phosphate minerals that preserve the morphology of the seed (Murphy, 2014). Mineralisation can also occur because some plants are particularly mineral-rich, and the phenomenon takes place prior to deposition. This is known as biomineralisation (Messager et al., 2010). For instance, mineralised seeds can be found in latrines or cesspits (Veen et al., 2013, p. 164)\n\n\n4.7.1.1.3 Waterlogging\nOrganic material maintained in a wet environment under very low oxygen levels (anaerobic conditions) can be preserved as the activity of micro-organism is low or entirely absent. Examples of wet environments include natural ones (lake, riverine, marine sediments, marshes, bogs, etc.) or man-made (pits, latrines, wells, ditches, etc.) (Spriggs, 2014). Waterlogged seeds do not degrade markedly, but their starch, sugar and protein content is low and their colour is dark (Weiss and Kislev, 2007).\n\n\n4.7.1.1.4 Desiccation\nThis phenomenon is limited to very arid regions (mostly Egypt, some areas of China and Spain), where the complete desiccation of the organic material prevents microbial decay. Where plant material is preserved through drying, the preservation is remarkable; for instance, even aDNA survives in desiccated seeds (Veen, 2018, p. 58).\n\n\n4.7.1.1.5 Metal oxidation\nPlant material can be preserved if found in proximity to metals. Metal oxides when the soil is moist, creating a toxic environment for microbial activity.\n\n\n4.7.1.1.6 Ceramic imprints\nThe imprints of seeds and plants on the wet clay can help the investigator recognise the morphology of the seed and identify the plant, however the organic material is not preserved and the marks on the pottery are the only visible remains (Schepers and Vries, 2022).\n\n\n\n4.7.1.2 Pollen\nTo write\n\n\n\n4.7.2 Methodological issues\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection in progress\n\n\n\nIssues: problems with the data and general problems in sampling\nBIASES: Talk about the biases and dataset problems here or do it in the Materials chapter?\n\n\nThe data collection process did not present major problems in taxa comparability, since the names of plant were matching. In some cases, it was only possible for the archaeobotanist to specify the name of the species (e.g. Avena sp.), or it was not possible to properly identify the taxa. In the latter case, I reported all the names that can possibly identify the seed (e.g. Triticum aestivum/durum). Quantifications on the archaeobotanical dataset were affected by several biases. The samples in the database have been collected using different variations of visual strategies. Visual sampling occurs when archaeologists can visually see or expect macroremains in the feature they are excavating. Common features from which samples are usually collected include—pits, hearths, filled anforae, etc. But “how can one argue that the contents of a pit reflect activities involving food specific to that context, if one has not examined samples from floor deposits into which the pit was dug, or the deposits overlying it?” (Pearsall, 2015, p. 75). Lennstrom and Hastorf (1995) lament “feature biases” in many archaeological excavations, as paleobotanists are often called after archaeologists have already recovered materials from specific site features. The authors call for a general misconception in the goal of archaeobotany—to collect as many macroremains as possible. This strategy is, in fact, not very informative about the relationships between plant remains and stratigraphic units, and the general deposition patterns in the site. For instance, Jones et al. (1986) were able to reconstruct the functions of structures and the methods of crop storage at Assiros, northern Greece, through a thorough extensive sampling. Pearsall (2015, p. 74) reccommends a “blanket sampling” strategy, which consists in collecting samples for flotation from each stratigraphical unit. The advantages of blanket sampling are manifold:\n\nIf in theory sampling from strategical features (e.g. hearths) maximizes the chances of recovering more macrobotanical remains, in practice this is not always the case. For instance, if a hearth was used on a regular basis, it could possibly have been cleaned of ashes frequently, and the excavator might have more luck sampling around it.\nIncluding the collection of samples from each layer in the excavation leads an uniform and standardised procedure, reducing the variation across samples.\nBlanket sampling allows an easier reconstruction of deposition patterns and of stratigraphic units relations as stated above. For instance, one can analyse differences in macroremains densities across samples.\n\nWhile archaeobotanists have advocated for more specific sampling strategies for over 40 years, none of the Italian excavations in this dataset applied blanket sampling, and sampling from features is still the most common practice.\n\n\n4.7.3 Quantifications\n\n4.7.3.1 Ubiquity\nUbiquity, or presence analysis, is a popular approach in archaeobotanical quantitative analysis. The method is straightforward—the number of sites/contexts where a plant is present is divided by the total number of sites/contexts under examination. If, for instance, an olive pit is present in 3 sites out of 10, the ubiquity for the olive will be 30%. The formula for the calculation is at follows:\n\\[\nU_x = (\\frac{N_p}{N_{tot}}) \\cdot 100\n\\] where \\(N_p\\) is the number of presences, and \\(N_{tot}\\) is the total number of contexts. The result can be multiplied by 100 to obtain a score in %.\nThis approach has both advantages and drawbacks. Presence analysis minimizes the impact of outliers (overrepresented plant species) on calculations (Wright, 2010, pp. 51–52), but the relative importance of a plant in a particular context is lost. It is also important to keep in mind that taxa richness is influenced by factors including sample size, deposition and preservation modes, and sampling strategies (e.g. sieving methodologies) (Pearsall, 2015, pp. 161–2).\n\nWrite about sample size problems and include a graph\nWrite about deposition and preservation\nWrite about sampling strategies\nWrite about the problems of this dataset that led to the choice of ubiquity as parameter\n\nUbiquity is the best option to immediately read the Italian peninsular botanical dataset. The variability in the seeds/fruits samples is too high, with different species being outliers in different sites. A likely reason for this is probably the poor sampling quality, usually occurring after an agglomerate of seeds is found during excavation. Normally, agglomerates are found in specific storage places or processing areas (e.g. wine/olive processing quarters), skewing the distribution of the curve. Ubiquity overcomes this issue, as it provides a score based on the percentage of presences of a plant species in the samples considered.\nIn addition to the general calculation of the diachronic ubiquity in the entire peninsula, it is also important to look for regional differences in the archaeobotanical dataset. To do so, I created an R function to subset data related to Northern, Central and Southern Italian regions. For a clearer reading of the plot, I divided the plants into–Cereals, Pulses and Fruits/Nuts. The results are in Chapter 5.\n\n\n\n4.7.4 Diversity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n\nIntroduce the concept of diversity. Why is it useful?\n\n\nSpecies richness (\\(S\\)) is the number of species found within a community or ecosystem. The boundaries of the region are defined by the researcher. While ecologists use sampling or census to obtain the richness value, archaeobotanists can only rely on sampling, counting the presence of species in the area under investigation (Moore, 2013). Species diversity is a measurement of species richness combined with species evenness, meaning it takes into account not only how many species are present but also how evenly distributed the numbers of each species are.\nThere are different ways to calculate species diversity…\nShannon-W"

    "text": "8 Context type\nIt is possible to examine the distribution of plants across different site types during the four phases under examination. During the Roman period, wheat and barley were most prevalent on rural and religious sites, in the latter being used as part of ritual offerings. Minor grains were widely distributed on religious and urban sites, with rural sites and villas also showing high percentages. Legumes were also used in religious offerings but were found on both urban and rural sites. Grapes were ubiquitous across all Roman sites, with particularly high percentages in urban contexts and being extensively cultivated in large Roman estates. Olives had lower percentages, as they cannot be grown in Northern Italy, where most of the samples were collected. However, they were still widely distributed across all contexts, with peak percentages in urban and religious sites. In the Late Roman period, olive presence significantly decreased in urban sites and villas, but remained relatively unchanged in rural contexts. Similarly to olives, grape decrease in the same contexts, but slightly increase in rural sites. In addition to rural sites, grapes are also diffused in over 66% of the fortified sites (castra) that start to appear in this period. It is noteworthy that fortified sites from the Late Roman period exhibit high percentages of both minor and noble grains, possibly being stocked with the addition of pulses such as faba beans and vetch. In the EMA phase, noble/minor grains and pulses are still present in almost any fortified sites, a situation that is similar to the one in rural sites. In rural sites however minor grains (40%) and pulses (32%) are less ubiquitous in this period, although this figure might suffer from sites that only published cereal remains. Grapes are present in every religious/funerary context, followed by fortified (71%) and rural sites (66%). If olive cultivation seem to decrease in this phase, it might be because most of the sites with archaeobotanical remains are located in Northern Italy. Olives are present in 50% of the religious sites and on 36% of villa sites. Olives are absent from fortified sites in all phases, probably as a reflection of the northern location of these sites. Both rural and urban sites increase the consumption of berries in this period (13-14% ca.), which are also used for funerary offerings (14%)."

If this section is kept, make sure to explain that ubiquity was calculated by macroregion only because it was more reliable etc etc\n\n\nThe heatmap (Figure 7.2) shows the diachronical ubiquity values of the Italian mainland. It is possible however to compare plants’ ubiquity values in different areas of the peninsula. The R function Ubiquity_macroreg_chrono() (Section 2.3) was created to subset data from Northern, Central and Southern Italian regions, using modern boundaries. Archaeobotanical data from Italy is scarce, and subsetting the dataset required a larger chronological division to have enough sites for a valid statistical interpretation of the results. For this reason, the ubiquity values are presented using the variable Chronology rather than subsetting the individual centuries. For a clearer reading of the plot, the taxa have been divided into–Cereals, Pulses and Fruits/Nuts. Some taxa have been omitted from the plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2.1.1 Cereals\nIt is interesting to notice how in the Roman age, cereals are similarly ubiquitous in Southern and Northern Italy, although there are some exceptions (i.e. einkorn, rye, oats, and proso millet) that can derive from the randomness of sampling. Unfortunately, only three sites provided botanical samples for Roman Central Italy and their values have then been omitted from the plot. These sites (all from Tuscany) were studied by the Roman Peasant Project (Bowes and University of Pennsylvania, 2020) and only reported three kinds of cereal: common wheat, emmer, and barley. Similar ubiquity values from Northern and Southern Italy in the Roman age may suggest similar production patterns in the whole Italian mainland, even though more data is required. In the Late Roman age, ubiquity data has been calculated for the three macroregions, with Southern Italy being the least trustworthy (five sites in total). Three crops are found on 62.5-75% of the Central Italian sites: common wheat, barley and emmer. Other cereals are present, but less ubiquitously. The cereal triad aforementioned seems to be diffused in the south as well. Conversely, in Northern Italy common wheat and barley were indeed important cultivations but had to compete with other cereals including millet, sorghum, and rye. The latter had a significant increase, being present on almost 30% of the Northern sites (as opposed to the Roman 15%). The Early Medieval age seems to mark a shift in Italian agricultural practices, as cereal ubiquities are much more variable regionally. In Southern Italy, the triad of common wheat, barley and emmer were still the predominant cereals. These cereals are ubiquitous in Central and Northern Italy as well, although these regions adopt polyculture with a diversified number of cereals. The samples from the Medieval age are fewer in number since the upper boundary of this project’s chronology is the 11th c. Despite the short chronology, it is possible to make some considerations. Medieval Centraly Italy relied heavily on common wheat, barley and emmer, with other cereals increasingly important. Barley is the most ubiquitous cereal in Northern Italy in this period, followed by common wheat, millets and sorghum.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.3: Diachronical heatmap of cereals in the Italian macroregions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2.1.2 Pulses\nIn the Roman Age, pulses are an important part of the diet and are cultivated both in Northern and Southern Italy. In the latter, vetch/broad beans are present in 22-32% of the samples, and lentils are present in 38% of the sites. In the Late Roman Age, broad beans are equally important in Central and Northern Italy, and peas are present in 50% of the Central Italian sites. In the Early Medieval Age, pulses are present in many Central Italian sites, especially blue/red peas, broad beans and other Fabaceae. Lentils and broad beans are also cultivated in almost half of the Northern Italian sites. The importance of pulses in Central Italy is confirmed by the 11th c. samples, where every specie is present in over 66% of the sites and Fabaceae and blue/red peas are found in every sample. Conversely, in Northern Italy broad bean is found in 66% of the sites.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.4: Diachronical heatmap of pulses in the Italian macroregions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2.1.3 Fruits and nuts\nOlive and grape are two essential cultivations in the Italian peninsula. Olive pits, as can be expected, are more ubiquitous in Southern Italy, where in Roman times are present in >87% of the sites and in over 58% of the sites in the following chronologies1. Conversely, grape is important in Central and Northern Italy in the Late Roman, Early Medieval and Medieval ages.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.5: Diachronical heatmap of fruits/nuts in the Italian macroregions"

By using measure space, the null hypothesis that the centroids and dispersion of groups are identical is tested. The null hypothesis is rejected if either the centroid or the spread of the objects differs between the groups. A prior calculation of the distance between any two objects included in the experiment is used to determine whether the test is valid or not2 (Anderson, 2017). In this context, the null hypothesis is that there is no regional difference in the cereals dataset, with cereals being evenly distributed across macroregions and chronologies.\n\n\nThe suggestion of an Early Medieval shift in cereal farming stated in Section 7.2.1 and Section 7.3.1 needs statistical support. Considering that data is not unimodal and that we are dealing with presence/absence analysis, the best choice is to use a non-parametric test as PERMANOVA on the early medieval botanical dataset. Prior to performing the test, it was necessary to pre-process data by:\n\nSelecting all the cereals columns of the plant remains table, keeping the categorical variables: Macroregion.\nRemoving empty rows (samples that only reported seeds/fruits, but not cereals).\nTransforming the raw counts into presence/absence, using the function decostand() (method=pa) in the R package vegan (Oksanen et al., 2020).\n\n\n\n\nShow the code: Pre-processing\n# Testing the results: Regionality in the dataset? \nlibrary(vegan)\n\nset.seed(29)\n\n# Pre processing: remove empty rows\n\n# Note: The input table is the CONDENSED table without totals\n\n# Selecting all the cereals columns of the plant remains table, keeping some categorical variables \ncer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.tot <- Df_Cond_Plants[c(4,5,6,7,11:19)]\n\n# Selecting all rows with data (since we selected only with cereals, and some sites only had fruits/pulses we might have empty rows)\ncer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.tot <- cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.tot[rowSums(cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.tot[5:13])>0,]\n\n# Assigning a column name \"Macroregion\"\ncolnames(cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.tot)[1] = \"Macroregion\"\n\n# Selecting the Chronology of interest (EMA) and excluding Central Italy\ncer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.tot<- filter(cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.tot, Macroregion!=\"Central Italy\" & Chronology==\"EMA\")\n\n# dividing categorical and numerical columns\ncer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.categ <- cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.tot[1:4]\ncer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.data <- cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.tot[5:13]\n\n# Converting the numerical columns into a presence/absence matrix (using method=pa)\ncer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.dist <- decostand(cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.data, method=\"pa\", na.rm=TRUE)\n\n\n\nAfter the pre-processing, it was possible to run the PERMANOVA using the function adonis2() in the package vegan. The function creates a distance matrix and computes an analysis of variance on the matrix. The method chosen to calculate the distance matrix is the jaccard distance. The Jaccard distance, based on the Jaccard similarity index, is a value of dissimilarity between sample sets (Kosub, 2019). When compared to other dissimilarity indices, it is more appropriate for presence/absence analyses as it is not based on Euclidean distance.\nResults of adonis2().\n\n\n\nShow the code: adonis2()\ncer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.div <- adonis2(\n  cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.dist ~ Macroregion, \n  data = cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.categ,\n  permutations = 10000, method=\"jaccard\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nPermutation test for adonis under reduced model\nTerms added sequentially (first to last)\nPermutation: free\nNumber of permutations: 10000\n\nadonis2(formula = cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.dist ~ Macroregion, data = cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.categ, permutations = 10000, method = \"jaccard\")\n            Df SumOfSqs      R2      F    Pr(>F)    \nMacroregion  1   1.3554 0.13066 7.8153 9.999e-05 ***\nResidual    52   9.0181 0.86934                     \nTotal       53  10.3734 1.00000                     \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nThe calculation of PERMANOVA on the Roman dataset using the variable Macroregion reported a not statistically significant p-value, suggesting a degree of homogeneity. On the other hand, when applied to the early Medieval dataset, the results were highly significant (0<p<0.001) with a 99.99% confidence. PERMANOVA has not been calculated on the Late Roman dataset as samples from Southern Italy were too scarce. To confirm the significance of the results of PERMANOVA applied to the EMA dataset, it is necessary to check that its assumptions are met (especially since we are dealing with small groups of data). Firstly, we check the homogeneity of variances. The function betadisper() from the package vegan provides the distances of group samples from centroids. If the variation is even, the null hypothesis of no difference in dispersion between groups is accepted. To test the variation, it is possible to use the analysis of variance (ANOVA).\n\n\n\nShow the code: betadisper()\n# We do not need to calculate the distance separately, but it will be useful later for the betadisper() function\n\n# Distance dissimilarity matrix with the Jaccard method\ncer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.dist2 <- vegdist(cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.dist, method=\"jaccard\", na.rm=TRUE)\n\n# Betadisper: distances of group samples from centroids\ncer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.betadisper <- betadisper(cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.dist2, cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.categ$Macroregion)\n\n\n\nResults of anova() on the betadisper.\n\n\nShow the code: ANOVA on betadisper()\n# We will see that the ANOVA's p-value is not significant meaning that group dispersions are homogenous \n#(\"Null hypothesis of no difference in dispersion between groups\"; https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/vegan/versions/2.4-2/topics/betadisper).\n\nanova(cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.betadisper) # This should not be significant!\n\n\nAnalysis of Variance Table\n\nResponse: Distances\n          Df Sum Sq   Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)\nGroups     1 0.0055 0.0054954  0.1752 0.6773\nResiduals 52 1.6311 0.0313675               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Groups dispersions plot with confidence ellipses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Boxplot showing equal distances from centroid.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.7: Results of the betadisper() (groups dispersions) on the distance matrix calculated with the Jaccard method.\n\n\nThe betadisper() graphs (Figure 7.7) show similar distances from the centroids for the categories Northern Italy and Southern Italy. In addition, the ANOVA on the betadisper() shows that the separation is not significant (p-value over the significance threshold), meaning that the groups dispersions are homogeneous. We can thus be confident in the PERMANOVA results and accept the difference between the two groups of sites under investigation. In other words, the Southern and Northern Italian group of sites are different during the Early Middle Ages for what concerns cereal farming.\nRunning the same tests on the Roman sites failed to separate the two groups of sites, confirming that there was not a significant difference in the types of cereals cultivated during the Roman age between Northern and Southern Italy.\n\n\n7.4.2 nMDS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes on terminology: Wasserstein metric\n\n\n\nThe Wasserstein distance (or earth’s mover distance) is a measure of distance between two probability distributions on a metric space.\n\n\nIn addition to statistically testing the separation between the Northern and Southern Italian early medieval cereals dataset (Section 7.4.1), it is possible to measure the distance between groups of sites both in the Roman and early Middle ages. For this task, a dimensionality reduction algorithm has been chosen: the non-metric multidimensional scaling, from the R library vegan. A more in-depth explanation of the algorithm can be read in Section 6.6.2.3. To avoid fallacy in computations, the macroregion Central Italy and the chronologies LR (Late Roman) and Ma (11th c. onwards) have been excluded from this test—the uneven distribution of the group of samples required a cautious approach. The nMDS has been run with a reduction to only one dimension, using KDE plots to visualize the results. Setting the dimension to one allows easier calculations of distance. In Figure 7.8 (a), it is possible to see the nMDS performed on the Roman cereals presence/absence dataset. As already pointed out, the PERMANOVA did not produce significant results for this dataset and the Wasserstein distance (calculated with the wasserstein1d() function in the transport library) is indeed shorter for the Roman dataset. For both chronologies there is an overlap in the curves, which is more considerable in the Roman age (indicating that the group of samples are more similar). The overlap for the EMA groups (Figure 7.8, b) is probably due to the fact that the presence of the noble grains is not by itself a ‘marker’ of Southern Italian sites—these grains are also very common in the North. The difference is that in the South noble grains are not cultivated in conjunction with other grains. The graph for the EMA chronology shows a clearer separation of the macroregional groups, with some minor overlaps. Moreover, the graph also displays variability in the Northern Italian dataset. The variability can also be assessed from the outliers in the boxplots in Figure 7.9.\n::: {.content-visible when-format=“html”} Source code:\n\n\nShow the code: Data preparation\n# DATA PREPARATION #\n\n# Creating a simple dataframe just for the purpose of the NCA\nDf_Cond_Plants_simplified <- data.frame(\n  \"Chronology\" = Df_Cond_Plants$Chronology, \n  \"Type\" = Df_Cond_Plants$Type,\n  \"Macroregion\" = Df_Cond_Plants$name_macroreg,\n  \"Weight\" = Df_Cond_Plants$weight,\n  Df_Cond_Plants[11:ncol(Df_Cond_Plants)]\n  )\n\n# Joining site typology categories to simplify the output, using library stringr\nlibrary(vegan)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\nDf_Cond_Plants_simplified$Type <- str_replace_all(\n  Df_Cond_Plants_simplified$Type, c(\n    \"Rural site, villa\" = \"Rural\", \n    \"Rural site, mansio\" = \"Rural\",\n    \"Religious, monastery\" = \"Religious\",\n    \"Castle\" = \"Fortified\",\n    \"Castrum\" = \"Fortified\")\n  )\n\n# Convert to Presence (1) / Absence (0) using library vegan\nDf_Cond_Plants_simplified[5:ncol(Df_Cond_Plants_simplified)] <- decostand(Df_Cond_Plants_simplified[5:ncol(Df_Cond_Plants_simplified)], method=\"pa\")\n\n# Creating dataframes for the chronologies R and EMA\nDf_Cereals_R <- filter(Df_Cond_Plants_simplified, Chronology==\"R\" & Macroregion!=\"Central Italy\")\nDf_Cereals_EMA <- filter(Df_Cond_Plants_simplified, Chronology==\"EMA\" & Macroregion!=\"Central Italy\")\n\n# Selecting only cereals from both dataframes\nDf_Cereals_R <- Df_Cereals_R[1:14]\nDf_Cereals_R[is.na(Df_Cereals_R)] <- 0\nDf_Cereals_R <- Df_Cereals_R[rowSums(Df_Cereals_R[,5:14] != 0) > 0, ] # Removing empty rows\n\nDf_Cereals_EMA <- Df_Cereals_EMA[1:14]\nDf_Cereals_EMA[is.na(Df_Cereals_EMA)] <- 0\nDf_Cereals_EMA <- Df_Cereals_EMA[rowSums(Df_Cereals_EMA[,5:14] != 0) > 0, ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Roman age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Early Medieval Age.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.8: nMDS reduction to one dimension performed on the Roman and early Medieval cereal datasets.

    "title": "Long-term Dynamics and Peasant Autonomy in the Italian Countryside",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Overview\nThis research aims to diachronically trace the patterns of subsistence, economy, and environmental change in relation to regional patterns of Italian peasantry in the 1st millennium CE. Scholarly debate on the dynamics of human-nature interaction in Italy during the transition from Late Antiquity to the early Middle Ages still leaves today some open questions. Were the former Roman economic structures and farming practices completely abandoned or did they find continuity during this turbulent time? Which agricultural strategies did peasants develop to cope with political, demographic and climatic change? Past work on agricultural production has been based upon literary sources and field surveys which identify boundaries; a multi-source archaeological study is absent from the discourse. Drawing on environmental proxies, such as animal, seed, and pollen remains, this project uses data from >309 sites 1 (190 botanical and 466 faunal samples2) and statistical/dimensionality reduction methods (CA, NCA, nMDS). Specific emphasis is placed on evaluating agricultural strategies during the shift from the Roman Empire to the politically fragmented landscape of early medieval Italy, to assess the role of political organization, economy, culture, and environment in the configuration of agricultural regimes and animal/plant husbandry selection. The integration of different sources is fundamental to casting new light on peasants’ lifeways, which may be obscured in the textual records, privileging elite contexts and high-status transactions. The Early Middle Ages mark a period of fundamental change when different geographical regions (and potentially micro-regions) developed their own political and economic frameworks for agricultural production. Bioarchaeological evidence can help visualise the landscape in which these changes were taking place, as archive collections of samples are subjected to new analyses in a holistic context, through the database I have constructed. For example, one can analyse differences in diet and production between elite, religious, urban and rural sites, and conduct regional pattern analysis. Preliminary results show indeed higher degrees of regionalization in agricultural strategies during the EMA. My dissertation will contextualize these findings against textual sources to assess how people used the Italian agricultural landscape, and suggest which agents were responsible for changes. I argue that the discourse on Northern Italian/French early Medieval production has heavily influenced interpretations of the agrarian economies of the rest of the peninsula."

In some cases, it was only possible for the archaeobotanist to specify the name of the species (e.g. Avena sp.), or it was not possible to properly identify the taxa. In the latter case, I reported all the names that can possibly identify the seed (e.g. Triticum aestivum/durum). Quantifications on the archaeobotanical dataset were affected by several biases. The samples in the database have been collected using different variations of visual strategies. Visual sampling occurs when archaeologists can visually see or expect macroremains in the feature they are excavating. Common features from which samples are usually collected include—pits, hearths, filled anforae, etc. But “how can one argue that the contents of a pit reflect activities involving food specific to that context, if one has not examined samples from floor deposits into which the pit was dug, or the deposits overlying it?” (Pearsall, 2015, p. 75). Lennstrom and Hastorf (1995) lament “feature biases” in many archaeological excavations, as paleobotanists are often called after archaeologists have already recovered materials from specific site features. The authors call for a general misconception in the goal of archaeobotany—to collect as many macroremains as possible. This strategy is, in fact, not very informative about the relationships between plant remains and stratigraphic units, and the general deposition patterns in the site. For instance, Jones et al. (1986) were able to reconstruct the functions of structures and the methods of crop storage at Assiros, northern Greece, through a thorough extensive sampling. Pearsall (2015, p. 74) reccommends a “blanket sampling” strategy, which consists in collecting samples for flotation from each stratigraphical unit. The advantages of blanket sampling are manifold:\n\nIf in theory sampling from strategical features (e.g. hearths) maximizes the chances of recovering more macrobotanical remains, in practice this is not always the case. For instance, if a hearth was used on a regular basis, it could possibly have been cleaned of ashes frequently, and the excavator might have more luck sampling around it.\nIncluding the collection of samples from each layer in the excavation leads an uniform and standardised procedure, reducing the variation across samples.\nBlanket sampling allows an easier reconstruction of deposition patterns and of stratigraphic units relations as stated above. For instance, one can analyse differences in macroremains densities across samples.\n\nWhile archaeobotanists have advocated for more specific sampling strategies for over 40 years, none of the Italian excavations in this dataset applied blanket sampling, and sampling from features is still the most common practice.\n\n4.7.1 Quantifications\n\n4.7.1.1 Ubiquity\nUbiquity, or presence analysis, is a popular approach in archaeobotanical quantitative analysis.

    "text": "5.1 Introduction\nDatabases are increasingly being used in archaeology to archive and collect data digitally. There are mainly two types of databases—relational and non-relational. A relational database is more appropriate for well-defined data structures which can be linked through a mutual attribute. It is built and maintained with Structured Query Language (SQL), which allows the user to interrogate the database through queries (Gattiglia, 2018). A SQL database consists of several tables containing information in columns (variables) and rows (entries). Each row is defined by an unique key. Examples of relational database management systems include—MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle Database. A non-relational database (NoSQL) is advantageous in the case of unstructured data, as data is archived as a single document rather than in a table. This structure allows much more flexibility, although NoSQL databases can be harder to use by non-specialists. Among the NoSQL database management systems, MongoDB is the most widely used."

    "text": "5.2 Databases in archaeology\nDatabases are used in archaeology primarily for two reasons—data management and data sharing. Most excavations are now working with databases, where the information concerning each stratigraphic unit and finds is recorded. Databases can also be linked and interact with Geographical Information Systems (GIS), that allow researchers to work with a spatial component. In many cases, this data remains private, even after the publication of the excavation results, although increasingly more teams are also making their data available to the public. The growing popularity of open data has also created the need for standardisation. Since the 1970s, researchers started working on thesauri (Figuera, 2018), dictionaries and guides for the correct archival of archaeological information (e.g. pottery classes, context types, chronologies, etc.). A shared system of naming practices is essential for sharing, integrating and analysing data. Recently, more standardised databases and repositories are being created and openly published:\n\nArchaeological Data Service (ADS). A non-profit organisation, based at the University of York. The website provides a large repository of downloadable archaeological data (mostly from the British isles) (Richards, 2021).\nARIADNEplus, a Horizon 2020 project funded by the European Commission aiming to build an integrated european archaeological data structure. Over 2 million datasets are part of this project, with the original data still managed by the original creators (Niccolucci, 2020).\n\nMost of the archaeological databases are based on SQL, as the visual relationships between different data structures are easier to understand."

    "section": "4.3 Creating an Environmental Archaeology database",
    "text": "4.3 Creating an Environmental Archaeology database\nAn integrated database with environmental archaeology data is still missing in Italy. A first step towards botanical data digitalisation has been the BRAIN project (Botanical Records of Archaeobotany Italian Network), a census of the Italian excavations that reported archaeobotanical data (Mercuri et al., 2015). The website, although not providing raw data, has been useful to the bibliographical research for this project. For what concerns faunal remains, a database is missing, although a pilot project was started at the University of Siena by Boscato et al. (2007). The database was created using FileMaker Pro and was likely never published.\nFor the scope of this project, it was thus necessary to create a database that contained raw environmental data. The creation of a database for this research responded to the need of a systematic approach in storing environmental data in a common format and in a way that is convenient for querying, rather than merely archiving the information. The goal is to have data readily available for exploratory data analysis, in an automated process that does not require to adapt the query and manually wrangle data each time a new sample is added to the collection. This project uses MariaDB, a fast and stable fork of MySQL.\nThe database was structured with the creation of 21 tables. The table site_list is the core table, from which most of the other tables in the schema depend. The entries in the table are based on the chronology of a single sample. The chronology is defined both by the macroperiod1 and by the centuries, with two columns: startcentury and endcentury. If a context has been sampled more than once, there will be as many entries as many chronologies. If a context has been sampled both for seeds and bones, the sample IDs will be recorded on the same entry (if the chronologies match).\n\n\n\nContext\nSample #ID\n\n\n\n\nImola, villa Clelia, 6th c.\n15\n\n\nImola, villa Clelia, 10th-11th c.\n16\n\n\n\nSince the table is context based, each site has been provided with an unique ID, so that if the site has been sampled in different areas the database can be still queried using the site ID2. In addition to the reference to the samples table, the table site_list also contains references to child tables with information about: site type, geography, altitude, coordinates, and region. The samples are organized in three tables, depending on the type of remain that has to be recorded in the database:\n\nplant_remains\npollen_remains\nfaunal_remains\n\nEach entry in the samples tables contains information about chronology, sampling type and notes, reference to the publication, reference to the main site, and the raw data. The tables faunal_chrono_weights and plants_chrono_weights contain the automated calculation of the samples weights (refer to Section 5.4.1). The Figure 4.1 shows the schema with the complete list of tables in the database.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Schema of the database, with the table site_list at the core.\n\n\nThe data was stored in the database after a thorough bibliographical research of the excavated sites (with a chronology pertaining to the 1st millennium CE) where environmental analyses have been undertaken. As in most of the cases the material was retrieved from physical publications, not digitised, the process of data entry was manual and could not be automatised. A list of the publication types where data was retrieved from can be visualised in Figure 4.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Count of the publication types in the database."

The last name is provided in full, while the first name is only indicated by the first letter. For instance, Jane Doe is formatted as “Doe, J.”.\nyear: numerical field of the type int(11), which provides the year of the publication.\nsite_code: numerical field of the type int(11), which provides the code of the site, from the field site_code in the table site_list.\npublication_type: foreign key, linked to the table bibliography_publ_type (See Table 5.7).\n\n\n\n5.4.1.2.2 Table: bibliography_publ_type\nThe table bibliography_publ_type is linked to the bibliography table and consists of two fields:\n\nuuid: a unique id for the publication type, incremental and auto generated.\nType: text field describing the publication type.\n\n\n\nTable 5.7: The table bibliography_publ_type.

The names of the plants were in fact matching across publications. However, in some cases authors could only identify the seeds’ species (e.g. Avena sp.), or it was not possible to properly identify the taxa (e.g. Cerealia und.). Specific taxa are indeed hard to identify without other elements of the plants; for this reason some taxa have been merged together in one column of the database. For instance, Triticum aestivum and Triticum durum are recorded together. Seed counts have been reported in the species column when an author reported a taxon rarely reported in other publications, rather than creating a new column for that taxon. For instance, Prunus armeniaca is reported in the column Prunus sp. In this case, the name of the identified taxon can be accessed through the extra_notes field.\n\n5.4.2.1.1 Table: plant_remains\nThe plant remains have been stored in the master table plant_remains. This is the main table that contains the absolute counts for each sample and it is linked to other tables, to locate the sample at site and chronological level. The fields included in the table are:\n\nuuid: a unique id for the sample, incremental and auto generated.\nsite_code: foreign key (linked to the table site_list) referring to the site where the sample has been collected. The input value is an integer of the type int(11).\nsite_type: foreign key (linked to the table site_type), referring to the typology of the site where the sample has been collected. See Section 5.4.1.1.2 for details of the input values.\ndata_valid_start: an integer indicating the first century covered by the sample. The value can be positive for CE centuries and negative for BCE centuries. For instance, if the author attributes the sample to the 2nd c. BCE to the 1st c. CE, the field will be filled with the value -2.\ndata_valid_end: an integer indicating the last century covered by the sample. The value can be positive for CE centuries and negative for BCE centuries. For instance, if the author attributes the sample to the 2nd c. BCE to the 1st c. CE, the field will be filled with the value 1.\nsampling_notes: a text field, of the type longtext, that can be filled with information concerning sampling methodologies, precise location of sampling (e.g. a kiln, a kitchen, a wastepit, etc.), a more precise chronological range (if the author provided a datation in years rather than centuries), preservation mode (e.g. charred, waterlogged, etc.) and further notes that might be useful.\nextra_notes: a multipurpose text field, of the type longtext, that can be filled with information concerning first interpretation of the layer or the data from which the sample has been collected. The field also reports if the excavation provided other archaeobotanical material not included in this database (e.g. anthracological analyses), or plants that are not part of this table (e.g. ruderals, weeds, etc.). Finally, the field also contains the breakdown of counts that have been summarised under one column. For instance, the field Cerealia at times summarises cereal types that are not recorded in separate fields; cereals as Triticum compactum are rarely mentioned in Italian archaeobotanical reports, and if reported on a separate field it would be underrepresented.\ndata_usable: boolean field. The value is 0 if the sample is not reliable (e.g. data too scarce, chronology too vague, etc.), but was recorded in the database as it might be useful for qualitative studies. If the value is 0 and the sample is hence not usable, the reason is reported in the field extra_notes. The value is 1 if the sample is reliable and it can be used quantitatively or for presence/absence analysis. Note that if the value is 0 the site will not appear in the map.\noverrepresented_data: a text field, of the type longtext, that can be filled with information regarding overrepresented taxa. This is a common occurrence in contexts as wine/olive processing areas or stocking deposits.\nreference_id: foreign key (linked to the table bibliography), referring to the bibliographical source that contained information about the sample. See Section 5.4.1.2 for details of the input values.\nvolume: an integer value reporting the volume (in litres) of the sample. Whenever more samples from the same location and with the same chronology have been reported by the author, they have been merged together and the volume represents the total of each sample. The volumes of the individual samples are reported in the field extra_notes.\nsampling_type: foreign key (linked to the table bot_sampling_type), referring to the sampling methodology used by the author. See Table 5.9 for details of the input values.\nno_of_samples: an integer indicating the number of samples collected from the context recorded in the entry. As for the volume field, whenever more samples from the same location and with the same chronology have been reported by the author, they have been merged together.\nFields for the absolute counts of the taxa: Triticum aestivum/durum, Triticum dicoccum, Triticum monococcum, Avena sp, Hordeum vulgare, Panicum milliaceum, Secale cereale, Setaria italica, Sorghum bicolor, Cerealia ind, Leguminosae, Lens culinaris, Pisum sativum,Vicia faba, Vicia sativa, Vicia sp, Lathyrus cicera/sativus, Cicer aretinum, Cornus mas, Corylus avellana, Ficus carica, Fragaria vesca, Juglans regia, Castanea sativa, Malus domestica, Olea europaea L, Prunus cerasus, Prunus avium, Prunus sp, Prunus persica, Prunus domestica, Prunus spinosa, Rubus fruticosus, Pyrus communis, Sambucus nigra, Cucumis melo, Vitis vinifera, Linum usatissimus, Sorbus sp. The fields are of the type int(11) and are filled with the absolute count copied from the author’s report.\n\n\n\n5.4.2.1.2 Table: bot_sampling_type\nThe table bot_sampling_type is linked to the plant_remains table and consists of two fields:\n\nsampl_id: a unique id for the sampling typology, incremental and auto generated.\nsampl_type: text field describing the sampling methods. Other sampling types that are commonly used in archaeobotany (e.g. total sampling, probabilistic sampling, etc.) are not part of this table as no excavation reported using them.\n\n\n\nTable 5.9: The table bot_sampling_type and its values.

In most cases, animal names were matching across publications. Whenever this was not the case, the scientific name of the species was provided, which was helpful in case of uncertainties (e.g. ‘Hen’ vs ‘Chicken’). Given the size of this project, not every species has been recorded in the database. Species that were not useful to the reconstruction of agricultural practices (for instance, tortoises) have been recorded in the field extra_notes of the table faunal_remains. Other species were merged together into a single column. This is the case of Mollusca. When authors were not certain about the classification of certain bones to the species level, they have been reported at the genus or family level. The most common occurrence is for sheep and goats, mostly reported under the Caprinae family, or for donkeys and horses, reported under the Equus sp.\n\n5.4.3.1 Table: faunal_remains\nThe animal remains have been recorded in the master table faunal_remains. This is the main table that contains the NISP counts from each sample and it is linked to other tables, to locate the sample at site and chronological level. The fields included in the table are:\n\nuuid: a unique id for the sample, incremental and auto generated.\nsite_code: foreign key (linked to the table site_list) referring to the site where the sample has been collected.

The value can be positive for CE centuries and negative for BCE centuries. For instance, if the author attributes the sample to the 2nd c. BCE to the 1st c. CE, the field will be filled with the value 1.\nsampling_notes: a text field, of the type longtext, that can be filled with information concerning sampling methodologies, precise location of sampling (e.g. a kiln, a kitchen, a wastepit, etc.), a more precise chronological range (if the author provided a datation in years rather than centuries), and further notes that might be useful.\nextra_notes: a multipurpose text field, of the type longtext, that can be filled with information concerning first interpretation of the layer or the data from which the sample has been collected. The field also reports if the excavation provided other information that are not included in this database, namely—age, sex, MNI counts, etc. Finally, the field also contains the breakdown of counts that have been summarised under one column. For instance, the field Mollusca or ‘Unsp. birds’; some types of birds are rarely mentioned in other publications, and if reported on a separate field they would be underrepresented.\ndata_usable: boolean field.

    "section": "5.3 Creating an Environmental Archaeology database",
    "text": "5.3 Creating an Environmental Archaeology database\nAn integrated database with environmental archaeology data is still missing in Italy. A first step towards botanical data digitalisation has been the BRAIN project (Botanical Records of Archaeobotany Italian Network), a census of the Italian excavations that reported archaeobotanical data (Mercuri et al., 2015). The website, although not providing raw data, has been useful to the bibliographical research for this project. For what concerns faunal remains, a database is missing, although a pilot project was started at the University of Siena by Boscato et al. (2007). The database was created using FileMaker Pro and was likely never published.\nFor the scope of this project, it was thus necessary to create a database that contained raw environmental data. The creation of a database for this research responded to the need of a systematic approach in storing environmental data in a common format and in a way that is convenient for querying, rather than merely archiving the information. The goal is to have data readily available for exploratory data analysis, in an automated process that does not require to adapt the query and manually wrangle data each time a new sample is added to the collection. This project uses MariaDB, a fast and stable fork of MySQL.\nThe database was structured with the creation of 21 tables. The table site_list is the core table, from which most of the other tables in the schema depend. The entries in the table are based on the chronology of a single sample. The chronology is defined both by the macroperiod1 and by the centuries, with two columns: startcentury and endcentury. If a context has been sampled more than once, there will be as many entries as many chronologies. If a context has been sampled both for seeds and bones, the sample IDs will be recorded on the same entry (if the chronologies match).\n\n\n\nContext\nSample #ID\n\n\n\n\nImola, villa Clelia, 6th c.\n15\n\n\nImola, villa Clelia, 10th-11th c.\n16\n\n\n\nSince the table is context based, each site has been provided with an unique ID, so that if the site has been sampled in different areas the database can be still queried using the site ID2. In addition to the reference to the samples table, the table site_list also contains references to child tables with information about: site type, geography, altitude, coordinates, and region. The samples are organized in three tables, depending on the type of remain that has to be recorded in the database:\n\nplant_remains\npollen_remains\nfaunal_remains\n\nEach entry in the samples tables contains information about chronology, sampling type and notes, reference to the publication, reference to the main site, and the raw data. The tables faunal_chrono_weights and plants_chrono_weights contain the automated calculation of the samples weights (refer to Section 6.4.1). The Figure 5.1 shows the schema with the complete list of tables in the database.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Schema of the database, with the table site_list at the core.\n\n\nThe data was stored in the database after a thorough bibliographical research of the excavated sites (with a chronology pertaining to the 1st millennium CE) where environmental analyses have been undertaken. As in most of the cases the material was retrieved from physical publications, not digitised, the process of data entry was manual and could not be automatised. A list of the publication types where data was retrieved from can be visualised in Figure 5.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Count of the publication types in the database."

The name of the discipline has been debated since its origins, with the first reference to its practitioners being “zoologico-archaeologists”. Mirroring the anthropological perspective of studying animal remains to gain insights into human behaviour, the discipline is widely referred as “zooarchaeology” especially in the Americas. The term “archaeozoology” is preferred by practitioners who emphasise the biological nature of faunal remains; especially in Africa and Eurasia. Italian scholars refer to the discipline as archeozoologia, reflecting this tradition. More alternatives are also available, including “ethnozoology”, “paleoethnozoology” and “osteoarchaeology” (Clutton-Brock, 2017; Reitz and Wing, 2008, pp. 4–5). Because this thesis deals with humans’ relationship with animals for economic and historical purposes, the term “zooarchaeology” will be used throughout this volume. The importance of archaeology in making inferences about historical environmental questions has already been emphasized in Chapter 3; as with archaeobotany, although textual sources can be useful in answering historical questions, zooarchaeology is essential for verifying and complicating our understanding of the past. Zooarchaeology studies both vertebrate and invertebrate remains. Depending on the research questions, a zooarchaeologist may focus on domestic/wild animals, on a single species, on a specimen (i.e., a single bone) at different scales ranging from a stratigraphic unit to an entire region (Lyman, 1994).\n\nWhat types of remains can we find?

The database storing procedures are described in Chapter 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection in progress\n\n\n\nShould the maps be here? Or maybe here put time slices maps\n\n\nThe objective of archaeobotany is to recover, identify, and document plant remains from archaeological sites to reconstruct past vegetation dynamics, human-environment interactions, and food production and consumption patterns. Archaeobotany can also be referred to as “palaeoethnobotany”, a term especially prevalent in North America. Although the word “palaeoethnobotany” places a stronger stress on the human and ethnic interaction with plants (Hastorf and Popper, 1988), the two words are used mostly interchangeably (Hastorf, 1999) as European archaeobotanists share the same objectives. It is important to emphasise that the term “palaeobotany” is not a valid synonym for archaeobotany, as it refers to the study of past evolution and adaptations of plants, and this discipline is not concerned with human-environment interactions (Fuller and Lucas, 2014). In Classical archaeology, some of the archaeobotanical research questions can also be inferred from historical literature. This is problematic, as the evidence often contradicts what is said in texts; Pearsall (2015, p. 27) remarks how the discipline works using an archaeological approach, not an historical one. Furthermore, the domain of archaeology stretches far beyond the chronological range of textual history. In the archaeological record, four types of botanical remains can be identified—macroremains, pollen grains, phytoliths (inorganic elements found in leaves, stems, and other parts of plants), and starches (formed by amylose or amylopectin polymer aggregates) (Pearsall, 2015). As most archaeobotanical studies in Italy deal with macroremains and pollen, this research will only focus on these remains."

    "section": "3.2 Macroremains",
    "text": "3.2 Macroremains\nMacroremains such as seeds, nutshells, fruit pips, and charcoal (wood preserved after carbonisation) are visible to the naked eye (> 0.25 mm). It is possible to recover macrofossils—in situ, by screening using sieves, and by flotation. In situ collection is possibly the most problematic, as it relies on the experience of the excavator and favours larger finds. In addition, light conditions and the colour of the soil might influence the ability to visualise seeds and charcoal remains. A solution to this problem is to use screening techniques, and choosing an appropriate mesh size can limit the bias for underrepresented taxa (e.g. particularly small seeds). Often, sieves of different mesh sizes are used at the same time for the purpose of eliminating as much soil as possible from the soil sample. In addition to dry screening, archaeologists also use wet screening. Wet screening refers to the practice of pouring water onto the sieve. It differs from wet sieving, which requires the submersion of seeds in a bucket with water that is gently agitated. In any case, adding water to the sieve can be counter-productive, as wetting might destroy the seeds if they are charred (White and Shelton, 2014). One of the most common types of recovery is by flotation, which encompasses several techniques, each based on the principle that water is denser than charred material. Flotation can be either manual or machine-assisted. The former refers to wet sieving, where seeds are submerged in water and the ones that float are recovered using a mesh. Tools and machines have been also developed for flotation, including the hand-pump (which does not require electricity) and other machine-assisted tools (see Figure 3.1) that use water pressure and aeration to separate the seeds from soil. Flotation also allows the recovery of other small-sized archaeological material, including fish and bird bones, and mollusca (Jarman et al., 1972; Turney et al., 2005, p. 125; Williams, 1973). After separating the seeds from the soil, seeds can be identified and quantified. For the identification, researchers use fossil reference collections and photographs (Turney et al., 2005).\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Example of a flotation machine. In the image, the so-called ‘Siraf’ type flotation machine, used at Pantanello (Basilicata). Image after Costantini and Costantini Biasini (2018, p. 373).\n\n\n\n3.2.1 Sampling\nA sample is a smaller subset of elements from a population. In statistics, a population is the entire set of elements which we can draw inferences from. Often, it is not possible to know how large is the population, which is then called universe. Whether consciously or not, archaeology has always dealt with sampling. Much of the archaeological record has been lost or destroyed in time, and what we are able to study is a smaller portion of what once was present (Drennan, 2010, p. 80). If we consider the entire statistical population what is currently available to the archaeologist, it would be possible to sample for instance each bucket of soil excavated and count the total number of seeds found. This will certainly provide the most accurate information, although it is almost never possible in real life situations. Common constraints are time, funding, number of excavators, etc. It is then up to the archaeologist to decide how to collect samples, which will be biased by definition since they will not reflect reality. Why bother with sampling then? Archaeobotanical macroremains can be smaller than 1 mm and sampling can provide more information than collecting seeds with the naked eye (i.e. no sampling) (Orton, 2000, p. 148). Moreover, an effective and robust sampling strategy can limit bias as far as possible and try to return meaningful samples. Depending on the context, resources and individual decisions, several possibilities are available—interval sampling, probabilistic sampling, judgemental sampling, total sampling, or no sampling at all (Jones, 1991). The first, interval (or systematic) sampling, consists in sampling at regular intervals. The intervals can be defined in space (samples evenly spaced out in a grid), in time (sampling every tot. minutes or every \\(n\\)-th bucket), or in the laboratory using a riffle box (a machine designed to divide samples). One drawback of this method is that the regularity in sampling might correspond to a regular pattern in the data, which may bias the results. Probabilistic sampling is a method often advocated for, but rarely used. This type of sample has the advantage of allowing the researcher to draw statistical inferences on the data collected, for instance to calculate the margin of error and confidence intervals. The simplest form of probabilistic sampling is random sampling, for example randomly choosing to sample a square from a grid or a bucket from a series of buckets. Another approach to random sampling is cluster sampling, which requires a prior division of the sampling population into clusters (e.g. by context, area, etc.) and then randomly select some of these clusters during excavation (Orton, 2000). One of the problems that may arise from random and cluster sampling approaches is that of spatial autocorrelation. As Waldo Tobler (1970) puts it:\n\nThe first law of geography: Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.\n\nOther forms of sampling include judgemental sampling, a feature based approach and total (or blanket) sampling which consists in taking a certain amount of soil from each excavated context. Both methods will be discussed more in detail below. Finally, an excavation can have no sampling at all. Most of the archaeobotanical samples with macroremains recorded in the database were collected using different types of visual sampling, not always made explicit by the authors. Visual sampling occurs when archaeologists can visually see or expect (i.e. judgemental sampling) macroremains in the feature they are excavating. Common features from which samples are usually collected include—pits, hearths, filled anforae, etc. But “how can one argue that the contents of a pit reflect activities involving food specific to that context, if one has not examined samples from floor deposits into which the pit was dug, or the deposits overlying it?” (Pearsall, 2015, p. 75). Lennstrom and Hastorf (1995) lament “feature biases” in many archaeological excavations, as paleobotanists are often called after archaeologists have already recovered materials from specific site features. The authors call for a general misconception in the goal of archaeobotany—to collect as many macroremains as possible. This strategy is, in fact, not very informative about the relationships between plant remains and stratigraphic units, and the general deposition patterns in the site. For instance, Jones et al. (1986) were able to reconstruct the functions of structures and the methods of crop storage at Assiros, northern Greece, through a thorough extensive sampling. Pearsall (2015, p. 74) recommends a “blanket sampling” strategy, which consists in collecting samples for flotation from each stratigraphical unit. The advantages of blanket sampling are manifold:\n\nIf in theory sampling from strategical features (e.g. hearths) maximizes the chances of recovering more macrobotanical remains, in practice this is not always the case. For instance, if a hearth was used on a regular basis, it could possibly have been cleaned of ashes frequently, and the excavator might have more luck sampling around it.\nIncluding the collection of samples from each layer in the excavation leads an uniform and standardised procedure, reducing the variation across samples.\nBlanket sampling allows an easier reconstruction of deposition patterns and of stratigraphic units relations as stated above. For instance, one can analyse differences in macroremains densities across samples.\n\nIn addition to choosing the most efficient sampling strategy, sample size is also a problem that has been discussed in archaeobotany. The sample size, often indicated in litres in archaeological reports, can be constant or variable depending on the context. The size can have important repercussions on the richness of the sample, a topic that will be dealt with more extensively in the chapter discussing the methods used in this thesis. In short, a particularly small sample size can affect the number of species found. In particular, rare species may be either not represented or under-represented (Pearsall, 2015, p. 160). While archaeobotanists have advocated for more specific sampling strategies for over 40 years, very few of the Italian excavations in this dataset applied blanket or probabilistic sampling, and collecting samples from features is still the most common practice.\n\n\n3.2.2 Preservation\nThere are several ways in which seeds can be preserved, among them charring (or carbonisation), mineralisation, waterlogging, desiccation, metal oxide preservation and as imprints in ceramics (Fuller and Lucas, 2014). This section will focus only on grain preservation, excluding wood remains, as anthracological data (charred wood) has not been recorded on the database. The mode of preservation has a strong effect on the species of plants that can be found in the archaeological level. Cereals and nuts have higher chances of being preserved by charring, while fruit pips, herbs and spices are most common in waterlogged sediments. Nuts, fibrous and oil-rich plants are also equally preserved under water. Desiccation greatly preserves several parts of a plant, although it occurs very rarely (Veen, 2018, p. 71). These factors influence the representation of plants in the archaeological context, and one must be aware that the most identified taxa may represent the plants that had the best chance of being preserved. The most represented taxa therefore do not necessarily coincide with the most numerous or used plants at the site being investigated (Pearsall, 2015, p. 42). Figure 3.2 and Figure 3.3 show how different preservation methods affect the representation of a taxon.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Preservation mode of species with more than five occurrences in northwestern Europe in the Roman period [c= charred, m = mineralised, w = waterlogged, u = unknown]. Image after Livarda (2018).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Preservation mode of three plant groups in medieval Britain [black = charred, white = waterlogged, grey = mineralised]. Image after Veen et al. (2013).\n\n\nA final comment must be made on the state of preservation of botanical macrofossils. Regardless of how the seeds have been preserved from deposition to the time of excavation, the state of preservation of individual seeds may also be affected by mechanical actions such as fragmentation or erosion. Indeed, it is not uncommon for an archaeologist to find seeds that are only partially intact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Fragmentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Erosion\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Several stages of fragmentation and erosion of seeds of Sparganium erectum. Image after Jones et al. (2007, p. 79)\n\n\n\n3.2.2.1 Charring\nCarbonisation is the most common way of finding seeds when excavating an archaeological site, most notably when using flotation on the samples. Carbonisation occurs when seeds (or other botanical materials) are exposed to fire at not excessively high temperatures and under anaerobic conditions so that the combustion process is not completed. Other factors include the proximity to the fire source, fuel type and elements associated to the seed (i.e. chaff and straw) (Turney et al., 2014, p. 93). Several experiments have been carried out to understand the way in which carbonisation takes place and for a review of the literature on this topic, readers can refer to Pearsall (2015, pp. 41–42). Charred seeds lose their original colour (turning black), but mostly retain their morphology although slightly changing their dimension. The chance of preservation is particularly high considering that charred material is not attacked by bacteria or fungi (Weiss and Kislev, 2007).\n\n\n3.2.2.2 Mineralisation\nMineralisation is a natural process that leads to the replacement of organic material with inorganic material. Through phosphatisation, soft tissue is replaced by calcium-phosphate minerals that preserve the morphology of the seed (Murphy, 2014). Mineralisation can also occur because some plants are particularly mineral-rich, and the phenomenon takes place prior to deposition. This is known as biomineralisation (Messager et al., 2010). For instance, mineralised seeds can be found in latrines or cesspits (Veen et al., 2013, p. 164).\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: Examples of charred and mineralised seeds from Herculaneum. Image after Rowan (2017).\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2.3 Waterlogging\nOrganic material maintained in a wet environment under very low oxygen levels (anaerobic conditions) can be preserved as the activity of micro-organism is low or entirely absent. Examples of wet environments include natural ones (lake, riverine, marine sediments, marshes, bogs, etc.) or man-made (pits, latrines, wells, ditches, etc.) (Spriggs, 2014). Waterlogged seeds do not degrade markedly, but their starch, sugar and protein content is low and their colour is dark (Weiss and Kislev, 2007).\n\n\n3.2.2.4 Desiccation\nThis phenomenon is limited to very arid regions (mostly Egypt, some areas of China and Spain), where the complete desiccation of the organic material prevents microbial decay. Where plant material is preserved through drying, the preservation is remarkable; for instance, even aDNA survives in desiccated seeds (Veen, 2018, p. 58).\n\n\n3.2.2.5 Metal oxidation\nPlant material can be preserved if found in proximity to metals. Metal oxides when the soil is moist, creating a toxic environment for microbial activity.\n\n\n3.2.2.6 Ceramic imprints\nThe imprints of seeds and plants on the wet clay can help the investigator recognise the morphology of the seed and identify the plant, however the organic material is not preserved and the marks on the pottery are the only visible remains (Schepers and Vries, 2022).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Cereal chaff and straw in a fired clay fragment from Pantanello (Basilicata).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Two-row barley triplet against a fresh triplet from reference collection.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: Examples of ceramic imprints.

    "section": "3.3 Microremains: palinology",
    "text": "3.3 Microremains: palinology\nPalynology deals with the study of pollen grains and spores. The former are produced by seed plants, angiosperms and gymnosperms, and are not visible to the naked eye; hence, magnification is required (Bennett and Willis, 2002). The grains are formed in the anther, and are used to transport the male cells to the pistil of another flower to fertilise the female eggs (pollination) (Bakels, 2020). The discipline of palynology also studies spores, micro-particles originating from fungi and algae. Prior to their deposition, pollen grains are transported in the air by wind, insects, bats and some bird species. At some point, the grains fall to the earth’s surface or in water. The phenomenon is known as “pollen rain”, and the accumulation of pollen deposited in a location can represent to a certain degree the collective environment that produced the sediment. Palinologists usually distinguish between off- and on- site pollen. Off-site pollen is collected from permanently waterlogged contexts as lake bottoms, bogs, etc. This approach is particularly recommended for climatic and palaeoenvironmental reconstructions, as pollen and spores are deposited and permanently sealed. On-site pollen is collected from archaeological layers and the nature of its deposit is much different than off-site samples (Bennett and Willis, 2002; Pearsall, 2015). Anna Maria Mercuri (2014) reports that:\n\nPeople and animals transported plant parts into the site through plant harvesting, on feet and skins, or by coprolites. Pollen accumulation was, thus, mainly the ‘result of human action’ and a true imprint of human behaviour.\n\nOff- and on- site pollen answer then different questions. If the former allows the archaeologist to draw inferences about past vegetation and land use, the latter are much more site-specific and provide us with more information about the plants in the immediate proximity of the site. An agricultural historical analysis of a single site would therefore be more appropriate with pollen collected on-site, however taking into account that the deposition of pollen grains can be the result of human and animal mobility (Mercuri, 2014) or imports (Bakels, 2020, p. 205). A correct environmental reconstruction of the area surrounding an archaeological site must then always consider more factors, such as combining pollen data with carpological data.\n\n3.3.0.1 Sampling and preservation\nPollen can be sampled from permanently wet sediments including—river beds, lake bottoms, peats, ponds. The catchment area of the resulting pollen diagram depends on the sampling location. The catchment area of samples from a lake bottom is wider in range, whereas a small pond has a relatively restricted range. In the latter case, it would be more appropriate to sample several locations to reconstruct the palaeo-vegetation of a region, provided the necessary funds and resources are available. In any case, almost 99% of pollen is deposited within 1 km of the original source (Armstrong and Brasier, 2005). In rare circumstances, it is also possible to sample from dry contexts as colluvia layers and buried soils. A colluvium layer is a superficial deposit produced by meteoric erosion on topographic slopes (Parry, 2011). Although not usually preserved in dry buried soils, pollen grains can be found in particular conditions, as in very acidic soils, where the microbial activity is very low. Other factors leading to pollen being preserved in dry soils are not entirely known in detail yet (Bakels, 2020, p. 215; Moore et al., 1991). The sampling locations mentioned above are off-site locations. On-site locations are mostly waterlogged archaeological contexts, such as—moats, wells, and cesspits. This type of deposit is not suitable for environmental reconstructions, as it tells about local dynamics and human behaviour. The collection of pollen samples must be accurate, because the risk of contamination with upper or lower layers is high. For this reason, it is essential to avoid layers that have been in direct contact with air. There are several techniques for collecting samples, in most cases a section is sampled to obtain a pollen diagram. Sections are sampled using zinc tins that are hammered into the section. The height of the stratigraphical layers are marked on the back of the tin, which is later sealed with plastic foil and stored. When sampling a section is not possible, samples can also be obtained through cores, continuous sections of sediment stored in a plastic cylinder. The coring process is described more in detail in Stein (1986). Although being more resistant to decay than seeds, thanks to an outer protective layer (the exine), pollen too is not exempt from preservation biases. Some types of pollen are not preserved at all, some decay faster and others last longer. Common causes of deterioration include—corrosion of the pollen exine (the outermost protective layer of the pollen grain) from biochemical oxidation, degradation from chemical oxidation in aerial and subaerial environments, mechanical damage (e.g. breaking of the pollen grain), and mineral deposition (Jones et al., 2007). Another source of bias is taxonomic under- or over- representation. Pollens that have a slow decay rate tend to be overrepresented, for instance in the case of the Asteraceae. Other sources of bias are represented by differences in pollen production of individual taxa. Plants that rely on animal pollination produce less pollen than plants that can only rely on wind transportation. Light exposure also contributes to the amount of pollen produced by plants (Bakels, 2020). Cereals are likely to be under-represented in pollen spectra as their contribution to the pollen rain is limited—the largeness of the pollen grains (> 0.40 μm) prevents them to be transported far from the wind as they fall to the ground. Even ancient and wild wheats such as emmer (Triticum dicoccum), which Johannes Iversen (1973) hypothesised were cross-fertilizing and releasing more pollen into the wind than modern self-pollinating wheats (i.e. bread wheat), seem to contribute only marginally to the pollen spectra (Bottema, 1992). One notable exception is rye (Secale cereale), a cross-pollinating plant, which produces a large amount of pollen grains (Piotrowska, 2012). For the reasons stated above, the situation illustrated by pollen diagrams does not entirely match to the reality of past environments. Several experiments with modern pollen have been conducted to attempt to correct these biasing factors using software and statistical approaches (Mehl and Hjelle, 2015; Middleton and Bunting, 2004; Sugita, 2013).\n\n\n\n\nArmstrong, H., Brasier, M.D., 2005.

    "text": "8.5 Test 1: Random forest\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMove this part to Methods\n\n\n\nEXPAND! Unpack!\n\n\nA random forest is a machine learning algorithm that is used for classification and regression tasks. It is called a “forest” because it is made up of many individual decision trees. Each tree in the forest makes a prediction, and the overall prediction is made by combining the predictions of all of the individual trees. The idea behind a random forest is that, by combining the predictions of many individual trees, the overall prediction will be more accurate than if any single tree were used on its own. The “random” part of the name comes from the fact that the trees in a random forest are built using a technique called random sampling, which helps to reduce the overfitting that can occur when training a single decision tree.\nIn this study, a random forest is used to identify the key variables that influence the farmers’ choices of domestic animals in the first millennium CE. The focus is on pigs, cattle, sheep/goats, and edible wild mammals. Five variables are used to predict the farmers’ choices: altitude, site type, macroregion, geography, and chronology. By analysing these variables with the random forest algorithm, the goal is to gain a better understanding of the factors that drive farmers’ decision-making. Random forests set to regression return the percentage of variance explained by the model and the mean of the squared residuals. The percentage of variance explained by the model is a measure of how well the model fits the data—it tells us how much of the variation in the data can be explained by the model. The mean of the squared residuals is a measure of the error of the model. In other words, it tells us how much the model’s predictions deviate from the true values in the data. A low mean of squared residuals indicates that the model’s predictions are close to the true values, while a high mean of squared residuals indicates that the model’s predictions are far from the true values.\n\n\nShow the code\n############################################################################\n##\n## RANDOM FOREST\n## Research questions:\n## 1.

In this case, altitude was found to be the most important variable, followed by macroregion and type/geography. Chronology was also found to be important, but not to the same extent as the other factors. It is important to note that this may be due to the fact that some entries in the dataset cover multiple chronologies. To address this issue, the analysis can be repeated using individual chronologies. This will provide a more accurate understanding of the factors that influence the farmers’ choices of domestic animals in the first millennium CE."

    "text": "9.1 Classifying the sites\nRandom forest algorithms are a popular method for classification in machine learning, and they have been applied to a wide range of problems. In this dissertation, they can be used to classify archaeological sites from the first millennium CE based on their botanical and faunal datasets. By removing categories that create bias due to insufficient data, the accuracy of the models can be improved.\nIn this study, I investigated whether the botanical and faunal datasets from archaeological sites from the first millennium CE could be used to accurately classify the type of site. To do this, I built random forest models for both datasets and evaluated their performance on a test set.\nBefore building the models, I preprocessed the datasets by removing categories that were likely to introduce bias or lead to misclassification. In the botanical dataset, I removed the Religious and Religious, monastery categories. In the faunal dataset, I removed the Necropolis category due to its low number of entries and tendency to be misclassified as Urban. I also removed the Rural site, mansio, and Shipwreck categories from the faunal dataset due to their low number of entries. Finally, the Castrum and Castle categories were merged in both datasets.\nAfter preprocessing the datasets, I split them into train and test sets, and used the train set to build the random forest models. I then used the models to predict the class labels of the instances in the test set, and compared these predicted labels to the true labels to evaluate the performance of the models.\nThe results of the study showed that both the archaeobotanical and zooarchaeological variables can be good predictors for site type. The archaeobotanical model had a predictive accuracy of 67%, and the zooarchaeological model had an accuracy of 76%. In both models, the classes that were most accurately classified by the random forests were Castles and Castra, and Urban and Rural sites. It is interesting to note that the model sometimes classifies rural villas as “Urban” and sometimes as “Rural”, accurately predicting their class label only about 50% of the time.\nOverall, this study demonstrates that random forest algorithms can be effectively used to classify archaeological sites from the first millennium CE based on their botanical and faunal datasets. By carefully preprocessing the datasets and selecting appropriate categories, the accuracy of the models can be improved, leading to more accurate predictions of site type.\n\n\nLibraries\n# Required libraries\nlibrary(vegan)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(randomForest)\nlibrary(caret)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData manipulation\n############################################################################\n##\n## Reformat the data so that:\n## 1.

    "text": "10.1 Environmental data for site type classification\nRandom forest algorithms are a popular method for classification in machine learning, and they have been applied to a wide range of problems. In this dissertation, they can be used to classify archaeological sites from the first millennium CE based on their botanical and faunal datasets. By removing categories that create bias due to insufficient data, the accuracy of the models can be improved.\nIn this study, I investigated whether the botanical and faunal datasets from archaeological sites from the first millennium CE could be used to accurately classify the type of site. To do this, I built random forest models for both datasets and evaluated their performance on a test set.\nBefore building the models, I preprocessed the datasets by removing categories that were likely to introduce bias or lead to misclassification. In the botanical dataset, I removed the Religious and Religious, monastery categories. In the faunal dataset, I removed the Necropolis category due to its low number of entries and tendency to be misclassified as Urban. I also removed the Rural site, mansio, and Shipwreck categories from the faunal dataset due to their low number of entries. Finally, the Castrum and Castle categories were merged in both datasets.\nAfter preprocessing the datasets, I split them into train and test sets, and used the train set to build the random forest models. I then used the models to predict the class labels of the instances in the test set, and compared these predicted labels to the true labels to evaluate the performance of the models.\nThe results of the study showed that both the archaeobotanical and zooarchaeological variables can be good predictors for site type. The archaeobotanical model had a predictive accuracy of 67%, and the zooarchaeological model had an accuracy of 76%. In both models, the classes that were most accurately classified by the random forests were Castles and Castra, and Urban and Rural sites. It is interesting to note that the model sometimes classifies rural villas as “Urban” and sometimes as “Rural”, accurately predicting their class label only about 50% of the time.\nOverall, this study demonstrates that random forest algorithms can be effectively used to classify archaeological sites from the first millennium CE based on their botanical and faunal datasets. By carefully preprocessing the datasets and selecting appropriate categories, the accuracy of the models can be improved, leading to more accurate predictions of site type.\n\n\nLibraries\n# Required libraries\nlibrary(vegan)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(randomForest)\nlibrary(caret)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData manipulation\n############################################################################\n##\n## Reformat the data so that:\n## 1.

Or maybe here put time slices maps\n\n\nThe objective of archaeobotany is to recover, identify, and document plant remains from archaeological sites to reconstruct past vegetation dynamics, human-environment interactions, and food production and consumption patterns. Archaeobotany can also be referred to as “palaeoethnobotany”, a term especially prevalent in North America. Although the word “palaeoethnobotany” places a stronger stress on the human and ethnic interaction with plants (Hastorf and Popper, 1988), the two words are used mostly interchangeably (Hastorf, 1999) as European archaeobotanists share the same objectives. It is important to emphasise that the term “palaeobotany” is not a valid synonym for archaeobotany, as it refers to the study of past evolution and adaptations of plants, and this discipline is not concerned with human-environment interactions (Fuller and Lucas, 2014). In Classical archaeology, some of the archaeobotanical research questions can also be inferred from historical literature. This is problematic, as the evidence often contradicts what is said in texts; Pearsall (2015, p. 27) remarks how the discipline works using an archaeological approach, not an historical one. Furthermore, the domain of archaeology stretches far beyond the chronological range of textual history. In the archaeological record, four types of botanical remains can be identified—macroremains, pollen grains, phytoliths (inorganic elements found in leaves, stems, and other parts of plants), and starches (formed by amylose or amylopectin polymer aggregates) (Pearsall, 2015). As most archaeobotanical studies in Italy deal with macroremains and pollen, this research will only focus on these remains."

During the Roman period, wheat and barley were most prevalent on rural and religious sites, in the latter being used as part of ritual offerings. Minor grains were widely distributed on religious and urban sites, with rural sites and villas also showing high percentages. Legumes were also used in religious offerings but were found on both urban and rural sites. Grapes were ubiquitous across all Roman sites, with particularly high percentages in urban contexts and being extensively cultivated in large Roman estates. Olives had lower percentages, as they cannot be grown in Northern Italy, where most of the samples were collected. However, they were still widely distributed across all contexts, with peak percentages in urban and religious sites. In the Late Roman period, olive presence significantly decreased in urban sites and villas, but remained relatively unchanged in rural contexts. Similarly to olives, grape decrease in the same contexts, but slightly increase in rural sites. In addition to rural sites, grapes are also diffused in over 66% of the fortified sites (castra) that start to appear in this period. It is noteworthy that fortified sites from the Late Roman period exhibit high percentages of both minor and noble grains, possibly being stocked with the addition of pulses such as faba beans and vetch. In the EMA phase, noble/minor grains and pulses are still present in almost any fortified sites, a situation that is similar to the one in rural sites. In rural sites however minor grains (40%) and pulses (32%) are less ubiquitous in this period, although this figure might suffer from sites that only published cereal remains. Grapes are present in every religious/funerary context, followed by fortified (71%) and rural sites (66%). If olive cultivation seem to decrease in this phase, it might be because most of the sites with archaeobotanical remains are located in Northern Italy. Olives are present in 50% of the religious sites and on 36% of villa sites. Olives are absent from fortified sites in all phases, probably as a reflection of the northern location of these sites. Both rural and urban sites increase the consumption of berries in this period (13-14% ca.), which are also used for funerary offerings (14%).\n\n\n\n\n7.5.1 Pre-processing and models\n\n\nCode\n# Eval is set to false because the models have been saved\n\n####################\n## NOBLE GRAINS\n####################\n\nNoble_Grains <- with(\n  Df_Cond_Plants.pa,\n  data.frame(\n  Chronology = Chronology,\n  Macroregion = name_macroreg,\n  Site_Type = as.factor(Type),\n  Geo = Geo,\n  Grain_Count = rowSums(Df_Cond_Plants.pa[,c(11,15)])\n  )\n)\n\n#Simplify categories\nNoble_Grains$Site_Type <- str_replace(Noble_Grains$Site_Type, \"Religious, monastery\", \"Religious\")    \nNoble_Grains$Site_Type <- str_replace(Noble_Grains$Site_Type, \"Castle\", \"Fortified\")    \nNoble_Grains$Site_Type <- str_replace(Noble_Grains$Site_Type, \"Castrum\", \"Fortified\")  \n\n# Convert to list\nNoble_Grain.list <- list(\n    NG_Found = Noble_Grains$Grain_Count,\n    NG_Tot = 2,\n    TC_ID = as.factor((interaction(Noble_Grains$Chronology, \n                                   Noble_Grains$Site_Type)))\n   )\n\nNoble_Grain.list$TC_ID <- droplevels(Noble_Grain.list$TC_ID)\n\n# Create a binomial model, where N is 2 because that is the total number of noble \n# grains studied in this thesis\nm_ng_type <- ulam(\n   alist(\n        NG_Found ~ dbinom( 2 , p ),\n        logit(p) <- TypeChr[TC_ID],\n        TypeChr[TC_ID] ~ dnorm(0,1)\n    ), data=Noble_Grain.list , chains=4\n    )\n\n####################\n## MINOR GRAINS\n####################\n\n# Convert to list\nMinor_Grains_Type.list <- list(\n    MG_Found = Minor_Grains$Grain_Count,\n    MG_Tot = 7,\n    TC_ID = as.factor((interaction(Minor_Grains$Chronology, \n                                   Minor_Grains$Site_Type)))\n   )\n\nMinor_Grains_Type.list$TC_ID <- droplevels(Minor_Grains_Type.list$TC_ID)\n  \n# Create a binomial model, where N is 2 because that is the total number of noble \n# grains studied in this thesis\nm_mg_type <- ulam(\n    alist(\n        MG_Found ~ dbinom( 7 , p ),\n        logit(p) <- TypeChr[TC_ID],\n        TypeChr[TC_ID] ~ dnorm(0,1)\n    ), data=Minor_Grains_Type.list , chains=4\n    )\n\n#saveRDS(m_mg_type, \"stan_models/m_mg_type.rds\")\n\n\n####################\n## LEGUMES \n####################\n\nLegumes <- with(\n  Df_Cond_Plants.pa,\n  data.frame(\n  Chronology = Chronology,\n  Macroregion = name_macroreg,\n  Site_Type = as.factor(Type),\n  Geo = Geo,\n  Seed_Count = rowSums(Df_Cond_Plants.pa[,c(21,27)]) # Excludes Unsp.

As not every sample reported cereals, fruits/nuts and legumes, a correction has also been applied to exclude contexts that did not report the three types of plant taxa under examination. This correction has however strong disadvantages as it removes sites where the absence of certain plant categories may have been deliberate (e.g., storages). However, if the figures vary considerably (especially in the case of the 11th century CE which only consists of 2 samples after the correction), the general trend is similar after the correction. Plant richness in urban contexts slightly decreases after the Roman age, but early medieval cities are richer in plants when compared to the Roman and Late Roman phases. In the 11th century, plant richness increases further. These values will be discussed in the results chapter.\n\n\nTable 7.2: Plant richness in urban contexts before and after (*) removing incomplete samples.\n\n\nChronology\nRichness\nSamples\nRichness*\nSamples*\n\n\n\n\nR\n6.5\n44\n8.45\n22\n\n\nLR\n5.9\n24\n7.2\n10\n\n\nEMA\n7.2\n25\n9.6\n8\n\n\nMa\n9\n8\n17.5\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.5.4 Correspondence analysis tests"

    "text": "4.1 Introduction\nThis chapter provides an overview of the zooarchaeological materials used for this research project. Literature review provided an historical overview of the discipline, while this chapter discusses the goals, types, and preservation modes of the remains. The storing procedures are described in Chapter 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection in progress\n\n\n\nShould the maps be here?\n\n\nThe objective of zooarchaeology is to recover, identify, and document animal remains from excavated archaeological sites to reconstruct the relationship between humans and other animals, as well as farming practices and food patterns. The name of the discipline has been debated since its origins, with the first reference to its practitioners being “zoologico-archaeologists”. Mirroring the anthropological perspective of studying animal remains to gain insights into human behaviour, the discipline is widely referred as “zooarchaeology” especially in the Americas. The term “archaeozoology” is preferred by practitioners who emphasise the biological nature of faunal remains; especially in Africa and Eurasia. Italian scholars refer to the discipline as archeozoologia, reflecting this tradition. More alternatives are also available, including “ethnozoology”, “paleoethnozoology” and “osteoarchaeology” (Clutton-Brock, 2017; Reitz and Wing, 2008, pp. 4–5). Because this thesis deals with humans’ relationship with animals for economic and historical purposes, the term “zooarchaeology” will be used throughout this volume. The importance of archaeology in making inferences about historical environmental questions has already been emphasized in Chapter 3; as with archaeobotany, although textual sources can be useful in answering historical questions, zooarchaeology is essential for verifying and complicating our understanding of the past. Zooarchaeology studies both vertebrate and invertebrate remains. Depending on the research questions, a zooarchaeologist may focus on domestic/wild animals, on a single species, on a specimen (i.e., a single bone) at different scales ranging from a stratigraphic unit to an entire region (Lyman, 1994).\n\nWhat types of remains can we find? Bones, mollusca, etc.\nThis thesis deals with NISP data because…"

By using measure space, the null hypothesis that the centroids and dispersion of groups are identical is tested. The null hypothesis is rejected if either the centroid or the spread of the objects differs between the groups. A prior calculation of the distance between any two objects included in the experiment is used to determine whether the test is valid or not2 (Anderson, 2017). In this context, the null hypothesis is that there is no regional difference in the cereals dataset, with cereals being evenly distributed across macroregions and chronologies.\n\n\nThe suggestion of an Early Medieval shift in cereal farming stated in Section 7.2.1 and Section 9.1.1 needs statistical support. Considering that data is not unimodal and that we are dealing with presence/absence analysis, the best choice is to use a non-parametric test as PERMANOVA on the early medieval botanical dataset. Prior to performing the test, it was necessary to pre-process data by:\n\nSelecting all the cereals columns of the plant remains table, keeping the categorical variables: Macroregion.\nRemoving empty rows (samples that only reported seeds/fruits, but not cereals).\nTransforming the raw counts into presence/absence, using the function decostand() (method=pa) in the R package vegan (Oksanen et al., 2020).\n\n\n\n\nShow the code: Pre-processing\n# Testing the results: Regionality in the dataset? \nlibrary(vegan)\n\nset.seed(29)\n\n# Pre processing: remove empty rows\n\n# Note: The input table is the CONDENSED table without totals\n\n# Selecting all the cereals columns of the plant remains table, keeping some categorical variables \ncer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.tot <- Df_Cond_Plants[c(4,5,6,7,11:19)]\n\n# Selecting all rows with data (since we selected only with cereals, and some sites only had fruits/pulses we might have empty rows)\ncer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.tot <- cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.tot[rowSums(cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.tot[5:13])>0,]\n\n# Assigning a column name \"Macroregion\"\ncolnames(cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.tot)[1] = \"Macroregion\"\n\n# Selecting the Chronology of interest (EMA) and excluding Central Italy\ncer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.tot<- filter(cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.tot, Macroregion!=\"Central Italy\" & Chronology==\"EMA\")\n\n# dividing categorical and numerical columns\ncer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.categ <- cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.tot[1:4]\ncer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.data <- cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.tot[5:13]\n\n# Converting the numerical columns into a presence/absence matrix (using method=pa)\ncer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.dist <- decostand(cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.data, method=\"pa\", na.rm=TRUE)\n\n\n\nAfter the pre-processing, it was possible to run the PERMANOVA using the function adonis2() in the package vegan. The function creates a distance matrix and computes an analysis of variance on the matrix. The method chosen to calculate the distance matrix is the jaccard distance. The Jaccard distance, based on the Jaccard similarity index, is a value of dissimilarity between sample sets (Kosub, 2019). When compared to other dissimilarity indices, it is more appropriate for presence/absence analyses as it is not based on Euclidean distance.\nResults of adonis2().\n\n\n\nShow the code: adonis2()\ncer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.div <- adonis2(\n  cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.dist ~ Macroregion, \n  data = cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.categ,\n  permutations = 10000, method=\"jaccard\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nPermutation test for adonis under reduced model\nTerms added sequentially (first to last)\nPermutation: free\nNumber of permutations: 10000\n\nadonis2(formula = cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.dist ~ Macroregion, data = cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.categ, permutations = 10000, method = \"jaccard\")\n            Df SumOfSqs      R2      F    Pr(>F)    \nMacroregion  1   1.3554 0.13066 7.8153 9.999e-05 ***\nResidual    52   9.0181 0.86934                     \nTotal       53  10.3734 1.00000                     \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nThe calculation of PERMANOVA on the Roman dataset using the variable Macroregion reported a not statistically significant p-value, suggesting a degree of homogeneity. On the other hand, when applied to the early Medieval dataset, the results were highly significant (0<p<0.001) with a 99.99% confidence. PERMANOVA has not been calculated on the Late Roman dataset as samples from Southern Italy were too scarce. To confirm the significance of the results of PERMANOVA applied to the EMA dataset, it is necessary to check that its assumptions are met (especially since we are dealing with small groups of data). Firstly, we check the homogeneity of variances. The function betadisper() from the package vegan provides the distances of group samples from centroids. If the variation is even, the null hypothesis of no difference in dispersion between groups is accepted. To test the variation, it is possible to use the analysis of variance (ANOVA).\n\n\n\nShow the code: betadisper()\n# We do not need to calculate the distance separately, but it will be useful later for the betadisper() function\n\n# Distance dissimilarity matrix with the Jaccard method\ncer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.dist2 <- vegdist(cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.dist, method=\"jaccard\", na.rm=TRUE)\n\n# Betadisper: distances of group samples from centroids\ncer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.betadisper <- betadisper(cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.dist2, cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.categ$Macroregion)\n\n\n\nResults of anova() on the betadisper.\n\n\nShow the code: ANOVA on betadisper()\n# We will see that the ANOVA's p-value is not significant meaning that group dispersions are homogenous \n#(\"Null hypothesis of no difference in dispersion between groups\"; https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/vegan/versions/2.4-2/topics/betadisper).\n\nanova(cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.betadisper) # This should not be significant!\n\n\nAnalysis of Variance Table\n\nResponse: Distances\n          Df Sum Sq   Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)\nGroups     1 0.0055 0.0054954  0.1752 0.6773\nResiduals 52 1.6311 0.0313675               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Groups dispersions plot with confidence ellipses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Boxplot showing equal distances from centroid.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.2: Results of the betadisper() (groups dispersions) on the distance matrix calculated with the Jaccard method.\n\n\nThe betadisper() graphs (Figure 9.2) show similar distances from the centroids for the categories Northern Italy and Southern Italy. In addition, the ANOVA on the betadisper() shows that the separation is not significant (p-value over the significance threshold), meaning that the groups dispersions are homogeneous. We can thus be confident in the PERMANOVA results and accept the difference between the two groups of sites under investigation. In other words, the Southern and Northern Italian group of sites are different during the Early Middle Ages for what concerns cereal farming.\nRunning the same tests on the Roman sites failed to separate the two groups of sites, confirming that there was not a significant difference in the types of cereals cultivated during the Roman age between Northern and Southern Italy.\n\n\n9.1.3 Quantifying the separation: nMDS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes on terminology: Wasserstein metric\n\n\n\nThe Wasserstein distance (or earth’s mover distance) is a measure of distance between two probability distributions on a metric space.\n\n\nIn addition to statistically testing the separation between the Northern and Southern Italian early medieval cereals dataset (Section 9.1.2), it is possible to measure the distance between groups of sites both in the Roman and early Middle ages. For this task, a dimensionality reduction algorithm has been chosen: the non-metric multidimensional scaling, from the R library vegan. A more in-depth explanation of the algorithm can be read in Section 6.6.2.3. To avoid fallacy in computations, the macroregion Central Italy and the chronologies LR (Late Roman) and Ma (11th c. onwards) have been excluded from this test—the uneven distribution of the group of samples required a cautious approach. The nMDS has been run with a reduction to only one dimension, using KDE plots to visualize the results. Setting the dimension to one allows easier calculations of distance. In Figure 9.3 (a), it is possible to see the nMDS performed on the Roman cereals presence/absence dataset. As already pointed out, the PERMANOVA did not produce significant results for this dataset and the Wasserstein distance (calculated with the wasserstein1d() function in the transport library) is indeed shorter for the Roman dataset. For both chronologies there is an overlap in the curves, which is more considerable in the Roman age (indicating that the group of samples are more similar). The overlap for the EMA groups (Figure 9.3, b) is probably due to the fact that the presence of the noble grains is not by itself a ‘marker’ of Southern Italian sites—these grains are also very common in the North. The difference is that in the South noble grains are not cultivated in conjunction with other grains. The graph for the EMA chronology shows a clearer separation of the macroregional groups, with some minor overlaps. Moreover, the graph also displays variability in the Northern Italian dataset. The variability can also be assessed from the outliers in the boxplots in Figure 9.4.\n\nSource code:\n\n\nShow the code: Data preparation\n# DATA PREPARATION #\n\n# Creating a simple dataframe just for the purpose of the NCA\nDf_Cond_Plants_simplified <- data.frame(\n  \"Chronology\" = Df_Cond_Plants$Chronology, \n  \"Type\" = Df_Cond_Plants$Type,\n  \"Macroregion\" = Df_Cond_Plants$name_macroreg,\n  \"Weight\" = Df_Cond_Plants$weight,\n  Df_Cond_Plants[11:ncol(Df_Cond_Plants)]\n  )\n\n# Joining site typology categories to simplify the output, using library stringr\nlibrary(vegan)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\nDf_Cond_Plants_simplified$Type <- str_replace_all(\n  Df_Cond_Plants_simplified$Type, c(\n    \"Rural site, villa\" = \"Rural\", \n    \"Rural site, mansio\" = \"Rural\",\n    \"Religious, monastery\" = \"Religious\",\n    \"Castle\" = \"Fortified\",\n    \"Castrum\" = \"Fortified\")\n  )\n\n# Convert to Presence (1) / Absence (0) using library vegan\nDf_Cond_Plants_simplified[5:ncol(Df_Cond_Plants_simplified)] <- decostand(Df_Cond_Plants_simplified[5:ncol(Df_Cond_Plants_simplified)], method=\"pa\")\n\n# Creating dataframes for the chronologies R and EMA\nDf_Cereals_R <- filter(Df_Cond_Plants_simplified, Chronology==\"R\" & Macroregion!=\"Central Italy\")\nDf_Cereals_EMA <- filter(Df_Cond_Plants_simplified, Chronology==\"EMA\" & Macroregion!=\"Central Italy\")\n\n# Selecting only cereals from both dataframes\nDf_Cereals_R <- Df_Cereals_R[1:14]\nDf_Cereals_R[is.na(Df_Cereals_R)] <- 0\nDf_Cereals_R <- Df_Cereals_R[rowSums(Df_Cereals_R[,5:14] != 0) > 0, ] # Removing empty rows\n\nDf_Cereals_EMA <- Df_Cereals_EMA[1:14]\nDf_Cereals_EMA[is.na(Df_Cereals_EMA)] <- 0\nDf_Cereals_EMA <- Df_Cereals_EMA[rowSums(Df_Cereals_EMA[,5:14] != 0) > 0, ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Roman age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Early Medieval Age.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.3: nMDS reduction to one dimension performed on the Roman and early Medieval cereal datasets.

As not every sample reported cereals, fruits/nuts and legumes, a correction has also been applied to exclude contexts that did not report the three types of plant taxa under examination. This correction has however strong disadvantages as it removes sites where the absence of certain plant categories may have been deliberate (e.g., storages). However, if the figures vary considerably (especially in the case of the 11th century CE which only consists of 2 samples after the correction), the general trend is similar after the correction. Plant richness in urban contexts slightly decreases after the Roman age, but early medieval cities are richer in plants when compared to the Roman and Late Roman phases. In the 11th century, plant richness increases further. These values will be discussed in the results chapter.\n\n\nTable 8.1: Plant richness in urban contexts before and after (*) removing incomplete samples.\n\n\nChronology\nRichness\nSamples\nRichness*\nSamples*\n\n\n\n\nR\n6.5\n44\n8.45\n22\n\n\nLR\n5.9\n24\n7.2\n10\n\n\nEMA\n7.2\n25\n9.6\n8\n\n\nMa\n9\n8\n17.5\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.2 Correspondence analysis tests"

By using measure space, the null hypothesis that the centroids and dispersion of groups are identical is tested. The null hypothesis is rejected if either the centroid or the spread of the objects differs between the groups. A prior calculation of the distance between any two objects included in the experiment is used to determine whether the test is valid or not2 (Anderson, 2017). In this context, the null hypothesis is that there is no regional difference in the cereals dataset, with cereals being evenly distributed across macroregions and chronologies.\n\n\nThe suggestion of an Early Medieval shift in cereal farming stated in Section 7.2.1 and Section 9.1 needs statistical support. Considering that data is not unimodal and that we are dealing with presence/absence analysis, the best choice is to use a non-parametric test as PERMANOVA on the early medieval botanical dataset. Prior to performing the test, it was necessary to pre-process data by:\n\nSelecting all the cereals columns of the plant remains table, keeping the categorical variables: Macroregion.\nRemoving empty rows (samples that only reported seeds/fruits, but not cereals).\nTransforming the raw counts into presence/absence, using the function decostand() (method=pa) in the R package vegan (Oksanen et al., 2020).\n\n\n\n\nShow the code: Pre-processing\n# Testing the results: Regionality in the dataset? \nlibrary(vegan)\n\nset.seed(29)\n\n# Pre processing: remove empty rows\n\n# Note: The input table is the CONDENSED table without totals\n\n# Selecting all the cereals columns of the plant remains table, keeping some categorical variables \ncer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.tot <- Df_Cond_Plants[c(4,5,6,7,11:19)]\n\n# Selecting all rows with data (since we selected only with cereals, and some sites only had fruits/pulses we might have empty rows)\ncer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.tot <- cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.tot[rowSums(cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.tot[5:13])>0,]\n\n# Assigning a column name \"Macroregion\"\ncolnames(cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.tot)[1] = \"Macroregion\"\n\n# Selecting the Chronology of interest (EMA) and excluding Central Italy\ncer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.tot<- filter(cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.tot, Macroregion!=\"Central Italy\" & Chronology==\"EMA\")\n\n# dividing categorical and numerical columns\ncer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.categ <- cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.tot[1:4]\ncer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.data <- cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.tot[5:13]\n\n# Converting the numerical columns into a presence/absence matrix (using method=pa)\ncer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.dist <- decostand(cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.data, method=\"pa\", na.rm=TRUE)\n\n\n\nAfter the pre-processing, it was possible to run the PERMANOVA using the function adonis2() in the package vegan. The function creates a distance matrix and computes an analysis of variance on the matrix. The method chosen to calculate the distance matrix is the jaccard distance. The Jaccard distance, based on the Jaccard similarity index, is a value of dissimilarity between sample sets (Kosub, 2019). When compared to other dissimilarity indices, it is more appropriate for presence/absence analyses as it is not based on Euclidean distance.\nResults of adonis2().\n\n\n\nShow the code: adonis2()\ncer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.div <- adonis2(\n  cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.dist ~ Macroregion, \n  data = cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.categ,\n  permutations = 10000, method=\"jaccard\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nPermutation test for adonis under reduced model\nTerms added sequentially (first to last)\nPermutation: free\nNumber of permutations: 10000\n\nadonis2(formula = cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.dist ~ Macroregion, data = cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.categ, permutations = 10000, method = \"jaccard\")\n            Df SumOfSqs      R2      F    Pr(>F)    \nMacroregion  1   1.3554 0.13066 7.8153 9.999e-05 ***\nResidual    52   9.0181 0.86934                     \nTotal       53  10.3734 1.00000                     \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nThe calculation of PERMANOVA on the Roman dataset using the variable Macroregion reported a not statistically significant p-value, suggesting a degree of homogeneity. On the other hand, when applied to the early Medieval dataset, the results were highly significant (0<p<0.001) with a 99.99% confidence. PERMANOVA has not been calculated on the Late Roman dataset as samples from Southern Italy were too scarce. To confirm the significance of the results of PERMANOVA applied to the EMA dataset, it is necessary to check that its assumptions are met (especially since we are dealing with small groups of data). Firstly, we check the homogeneity of variances. The function betadisper() from the package vegan provides the distances of group samples from centroids. If the variation is even, the null hypothesis of no difference in dispersion between groups is accepted. To test the variation, it is possible to use the analysis of variance (ANOVA).\n\n\n\nShow the code: betadisper()\n# We do not need to calculate the distance separately, but it will be useful later for the betadisper() function\n\n# Distance dissimilarity matrix with the Jaccard method\ncer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.dist2 <- vegdist(cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.dist, method=\"jaccard\", na.rm=TRUE)\n\n# Betadisper: distances of group samples from centroids\ncer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.betadisper <- betadisper(cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.dist2, cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.categ$Macroregion)\n\n\n\nResults of anova() on the betadisper.\n\n\nShow the code: ANOVA on betadisper()\n# We will see that the ANOVA's p-value is not significant meaning that group dispersions are homogenous \n#(\"Null hypothesis of no difference in dispersion between groups\"; https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/vegan/versions/2.4-2/topics/betadisper).\n\nanova(cer_macroreg_ubiquity_transp.betadisper) # This should not be significant!\n\n\nAnalysis of Variance Table\n\nResponse: Distances\n          Df Sum Sq   Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)\nGroups     1 0.0055 0.0054954  0.1752 0.6773\nResiduals 52 1.6311 0.0313675               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Groups dispersions plot with confidence ellipses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Boxplot showing equal distances from centroid.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.2: Results of the betadisper() (groups dispersions) on the distance matrix calculated with the Jaccard method.\n\n\nThe betadisper() graphs (Figure 9.2) show similar distances from the centroids for the categories Northern Italy and Southern Italy. In addition, the ANOVA on the betadisper() shows that the separation is not significant (p-value over the significance threshold), meaning that the groups dispersions are homogeneous. We can thus be confident in the PERMANOVA results and accept the difference between the two groups of sites under investigation. In other words, the Southern and Northern Italian group of sites are different during the Early Middle Ages for what concerns cereal farming.\nRunning the same tests on the Roman sites failed to separate the two groups of sites, confirming that there was not a significant difference in the types of cereals cultivated during the Roman age between Northern and Southern Italy.\n\n\n9.1.2 Quantifying the separation: nMDS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes on terminology: Wasserstein metric\n\n\n\nThe Wasserstein distance (or earth’s mover distance) is a measure of distance between two probability distributions on a metric space.\n\n\nIn addition to statistically testing the separation between the Northern and Southern Italian early medieval cereals dataset (Section 9.1.1), it is possible to measure the distance between groups of sites both in the Roman and early Middle ages. For this task, a dimensionality reduction algorithm has been chosen: the non-metric multidimensional scaling, from the R library vegan. A more in-depth explanation of the algorithm can be read in Section 6.6.2.3. To avoid fallacy in computations, the macroregion Central Italy and the chronologies LR (Late Roman) and Ma (11th c. onwards) have been excluded from this test—the uneven distribution of the group of samples required a cautious approach. The nMDS has been run with a reduction to only one dimension, using KDE plots to visualize the results. Setting the dimension to one allows easier calculations of distance. In Figure 9.3 (a), it is possible to see the nMDS performed on the Roman cereals presence/absence dataset. As already pointed out, the PERMANOVA did not produce significant results for this dataset and the Wasserstein distance (calculated with the wasserstein1d() function in the transport library) is indeed shorter for the Roman dataset. For both chronologies there is an overlap in the curves, which is more considerable in the Roman age (indicating that the group of samples are more similar). The overlap for the EMA groups (Figure 9.3, b) is probably due to the fact that the presence of the noble grains is not by itself a ‘marker’ of Southern Italian sites—these grains are also very common in the North. The difference is that in the South noble grains are not cultivated in conjunction with other grains. The graph for the EMA chronology shows a clearer separation of the macroregional groups, with some minor overlaps. Moreover, the graph also displays variability in the Northern Italian dataset. The variability can also be assessed from the outliers in the boxplots in Figure 9.4.\n\nSource code:\n\n\nShow the code: Data preparation\n# DATA PREPARATION #\n\n# Creating a simple dataframe just for the purpose of the NCA\nDf_Cond_Plants_simplified <- data.frame(\n  \"Chronology\" = Df_Cond_Plants$Chronology, \n  \"Type\" = Df_Cond_Plants$Type,\n  \"Macroregion\" = Df_Cond_Plants$name_macroreg,\n  \"Weight\" = Df_Cond_Plants$weight,\n  Df_Cond_Plants[11:ncol(Df_Cond_Plants)]\n  )\n\n# Joining site typology categories to simplify the output, using library stringr\nlibrary(vegan)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\nDf_Cond_Plants_simplified$Type <- str_replace_all(\n  Df_Cond_Plants_simplified$Type, c(\n    \"Rural site, villa\" = \"Rural\", \n    \"Rural site, mansio\" = \"Rural\",\n    \"Religious, monastery\" = \"Religious\",\n    \"Castle\" = \"Fortified\",\n    \"Castrum\" = \"Fortified\")\n  )\n\n# Convert to Presence (1) / Absence (0) using library vegan\nDf_Cond_Plants_simplified[5:ncol(Df_Cond_Plants_simplified)] <- decostand(Df_Cond_Plants_simplified[5:ncol(Df_Cond_Plants_simplified)], method=\"pa\")\n\n# Creating dataframes for the chronologies R and EMA\nDf_Cereals_R <- filter(Df_Cond_Plants_simplified, Chronology==\"R\" & Macroregion!=\"Central Italy\")\nDf_Cereals_EMA <- filter(Df_Cond_Plants_simplified, Chronology==\"EMA\" & Macroregion!=\"Central Italy\")\n\n# Selecting only cereals from both dataframes\nDf_Cereals_R <- Df_Cereals_R[1:14]\nDf_Cereals_R[is.na(Df_Cereals_R)] <- 0\nDf_Cereals_R <- Df_Cereals_R[rowSums(Df_Cereals_R[,5:14] != 0) > 0, ] # Removing empty rows\n\nDf_Cereals_EMA <- Df_Cereals_EMA[1:14]\nDf_Cereals_EMA[is.na(Df_Cereals_EMA)] <- 0\nDf_Cereals_EMA <- Df_Cereals_EMA[rowSums(Df_Cereals_EMA[,5:14] != 0) > 0, ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Roman age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Early Medieval Age.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.3: nMDS reduction to one dimension performed on the Roman and early Medieval cereal datasets.
