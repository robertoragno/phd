## Introduction

## Continuity vs rupture

-   Cite @scottGrainDeepHistory2017, and @squatritiWeedsCarolingiansEmpire2022 [p. 36] for the "grain states"

## Environmental archaeology

Maybe move the processual arch. part somewhere here or create a general 'science in arch' section

-   Environmental sub-fields as archaeobotany and zooarchaeology have allowed to fact-check some assumption about food consumption in the Classical age that most of the times were not true, or the reality was not so black or white.

-   Autoecological vs Synecological approaches

### Archaeobotany {style="text-align:justify"}

::: callout-important
## Section in progress {style="text-align:justify;"}

Moved the introduction to archaeobotany in methods. Here I should explain the advancement of archaeobotany in classical and medieval archaeology, why it has been used, the databases for Italy and Europe, etc..

Early practitioners...

Macroremains were also the first plant fossils to be studied in archaeology in the 19th century [@lodwickArchaeobotanicalResearchClassical2022].

For palinology: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00334-020-00773-3

For the bias in the archaeobotanical research in Italy read Heinrich 2017

### Zooarchaeology

Classical intro with name zooarchaeology vs archaeozoology

## Landscape studies

## Diet studies

Meat consumption: Have a look at Kron Geoffrey. Roman Livestock Farming in Southern Italy : the Case against Environmental Determinism . In: Espaces intégrés et ressources naturelles dans l'Empire romain. Actes du colloque de l'Université de Laval - Québec (5-8 mars 2003) Besançon : Institut des Sciences et Techniques de l'Antiquité, 2004. pp. 119-134. (Collection « ISTA », 939); -\> Pages 122-123

## Big data in archaeology

## Statistical analysis in archaeology

General introduction (Shennan?)

In archaeology, multivariate statistics has been applied since the mid-60s, when the spread of computers and statistical packages made these methods more easily applicable. The growing popularity of computational archaeology in this period also owes a great debt to the New Archaeology movement (or Processual archaeology). New Archaeology emphasized the application of rigorous scientific analysis at the expense of the cultural historical approach which focused on artifacts cataloging based on ethnic grouping (@binfordNewPerspectivesArchaeology1968).

Include Baxter and Drennan

## Conclusions

## Something that I might need to explore or add:

-   Agriculture in Roman Italy: what are the main consequences? Is there any link between agricultural shifts and movement of settlements?

-   Continuity in field system

-   Is there an early medieval agricultural shift? Or Medieval? Consequences in terms of settlement patterns? more villages? more cities?

-   Is there any evidence for grain dryers?

-   Crop deposits: Where do they exist? Do they indicate monoculture or crop rotation? (This shouldnt be in the lit review of course). Hamerow and McKerracher

-   Are crop storage/deposits rare? Crop storages vs Grain dryers (essiccatoi)?
