In the first millennium CE, Italy experienced significant historical changes. The region was shaped by various invasions, conflicts, and demographic shifts. Northern Italy garnered new political relevance around the time of Germanic migrations from the Alps, and the capture of the western Roman Empire in 476 CE. Ravenna, situated on the coast of modern Emilia-Romagna, became a crucial center of power as Odoacer deposed the last Roman emperor and began his rule of Italy. Subsequently, Theodoric led the Ostrogoths in an invasion of Italy, responding to the Byzantine emperor Zeno's orders. The Ostrogoths established their dominance, ruling until 554 CE. However, the Gothic Wars (535--554 CE), waged between the Eastern Roman Empire and the Ostrogoth kingdom for two decades, caused great instabilities in the peninsula. Cities were destroyed, infrastructure was ruined, and the population suffered significant losses. In 568--569 CE, the Lombards initiated their conquest of Italy, adding another layer of complexity to the political landscape. Although unable to conquer the entire peninsula, the Lombards faced resistance from the Byzantine Empire in the south and encountered various independent duchies in the north. Several Lombard dukes vied for territorial power, contributing to a disorganized and chaotic campaign. The Lombard kingdom was roughly divided into two regions: *Longobardia Maior* (Greater Lombardy) in the north and *Longobardia Minor* (Lesser Lombardy) in central-southern Italy. Pavia, located in *Longobardia Maior* within the Lombardy region, served as the capital and a significant political and cultural center for the Lombards in the north. They had control over territories such as Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna and parts of Veneto and Piedmont. In *Longobardia Minor*, the capital was established in the city of Benevento, located in the Campania region of today's southern Italy. Benevento served as the political and administrative center for the Lombards in central-southern Italy. They controlled parts of modern-day Campania, Apulia, Calabria, Basilicata, and Molise. In addition, the Lombards held the Duchy of Spoleto, based in the city of Spoleto in central Italy. Spoleto was an important Lombard duchy that included parts of Umbria, Latium and Marche. However, the Lombard kingdom faced challenges and conflicts with the Byzantine Empire in the south and encountered rivalries within their own kingdom. These internal divisions and power struggles contributed to a fragmented political landscape, with different regions under the control of various rulers. The political dynamics in the Lombard kingdom continued to evolve, influenced by external powers such as the Franks. Under Charlemagne, the Franks conquered the north of Italy in 774 CE [@wickham2005, pp.33-35]. The subsequent division of the Carolingian Empire and the emergence of feudal states further contributed to the political complexities of Northern and Southern Italy. After the Frankish conquest, the borders of Northern Italy moved several times, reconfiguring along political lines. When Louis the Pious (Charlemagne's son) divided the kingdom into three parts in his Treaty of Verdun (843 CE), Lothar I was proclaimed "king of the Lombards" in Italy [@collins2010, p.306]. The further division of the Carolingian empire in 887 CE caused anarchy and the emergence of feudal states in Northern Italy [@sergi2000]. Further instability throughout the 9^th^ century was caused by the arrival of Muslim raiders from North Africa known as the Saracens. The Saracen invasions caused widespread devastation along the Italian coasts, especially in the South, disrupting trade and commerce and threatening the security of the region. These rapid and almost frantic political changes in Italy were also accompanied by a decline in the regional demography. The overall Italian population decreased from 10 million in the 5^th^ century to 8 million in the 6^th^ century [@locascio2005]. The demography remained constant until the 10^th^ century, but then it gradually increased. Among the causes of this phenomenon, diseases played a major role because illness was exacerbated by non-favourable climatic conditions [@barbiera2009]. Two climatic anomalies affected the temperatures of the Northern Hemisphere in the Early Middle Ages. These two events are known as the Late Antique Little Ice Age (536-660 CE ca.) and the Medieval Warm Period (900-1300 CE ca.).

## The Agricultural Economy

Role of political organization, economy, culture, and environment in shaping agricultural regimes and animal/plant husbandry selection. Influence of elite contexts and high-status transactions on the interpretation of agricultural production. - Crop deposits: Where do they exist? Do they indicate monoculture or crop rotation? (This shouldnt be in the lit review of course). Hamerow and McKerracher. - No database for these.

Say that agriculture was for sure the main sector of economy and rural economy (at least for the Roman period, see Heinrich 2017)

-   Use this to say that it is not simple to identify Roman peasantry through archaeology etc

-   Bowes 2021: p.13 archaeological examples of non elite excavations in Italy

-   Say that the Roman section will be longer because there are more textual sources, historical debate, theoretical discussions and also because some of the topics will be introduced for the first time and won't be repeated later on

### The Roman imperial phase {style="text-align:justify;"}

When examining agriculture in the late Roman Republic and Empire, there is a prevalent image of a *dominus* overseeing a vast estate, known as a *villa*, with enslaved individuals working in the fields. This image, influenced by classical texts such as Cato's *De agri cultura* and Columella's *De re rustica*, has led to the association of Roman agriculture with a quasi-capitalist framework. While scholars like Max @weber2008 have acknowledged capitalist elements in the Roman economy, such as its inclination towards a market system, they have not fully recognized capitalism in Roman agriculture [@love1986]. The absence of a labour market and the prevalence of slavery pose challenges to the direct application of a capitalist framework in understanding Roman agricultural practices. Moses @finley1973 adopted a "primitivist" approach, aligning with some of Weber's perspectives. Finley argued that Roman agriculture primarily operated under a pre-capitalist mode of production. According to Finley, the Roman agricultural system relied heavily on personal relationships, social status, patronage, and traditional forms of labour organization, rather than conforming to capitalist market dynamics. He contended that the Roman elite lacked the entrepreneurial mindset necessary for economic and technological growth [@theecon2017a, p.16]. This position was much criticised by the "modernists", notably Peter Temin [-@temin2013, p.114], who instead believed that ancient Rome had a labour market and questioned the notion that slavery indicated a non-market economy, especially considering the unique characteristics of ancient slavery in comparison to its modern counterpart. Temin [-@temin2013, p.4] famously argued that "the economy of the early Roman Empire was primarily a market economy". Modernist approaches conceptualise classical economy in a similar fashion to the modern one, with mechanisms of supply and demand. The existence of a market system is evident in the transportation of agricultural products across the peninsula and the broader Roman Empire. The movement of such goods indicates the presence of economic exchanges and trade networks. Furthermore, specific agricultural products became associated with particular regions or places, highlighting the localization of production. For instance, in the Roman *suburbium*, one could find pears from Signia, nuts from Praeneste, and *pastio villatica* (the production of luxury items such as small birds, honey, flowers for banquets, etc.) from Tarquinii [@marzanoNonSoloVino2008; @morley1996, pp.88-89].

![Production in the Roman *suburbium*. Image after @morley1996 [p.84].](images/Morley%201986%20%20p%2084.png){fig-align="center" width="501"}

Several adjustments to both models have been put forth more recently, with some scholars arguing that the primitivist/modernist dichotomy is too extreme and that more recent economical frameworks need to be considered, specifically New Institutional Economics (NIE) and Complexity Economics (CE) [@reframin2022a, p.2]. The first, NIE, considers the role of institutions and organizations in driving the economic behaviour of societies. In this approach, economic growth is only obtained through a market system [@thecamb2007]. The lack of agency in NIE has been criticised by @urbancr2016 [p.4], who believe that institutions are just starting points for economic strategies. In turn, CE is more dynamic, allowing agents to create and adapt strategies according to specific situations: economic systems are in fact "complex adaptive systems" [@complexi2021; @reframin2022a, p.6]. As noted by Kim @bowes2021, alongside the on-going academic debate on which economic framework is best suited for Roman economy, the study of the ancient economy experienced a significant shift in the 1990s with some historians embracing a cliometric turn. Scholars increasingly employed quantitative methods and sought to quantify various aspects of the Roman economy, including the measurement of gross domestic product (GDP), economic performance, inequality, and other key indicators. Some of these methods are collected in the work "Quantifying the Roman Economy: Methods and Problems" [@quantify2009]. While the integration of quantitative approaches in ancient economics is on the rise, it is important to acknowledge that these methods are not without their limitations. In this respect, @bowes2021 [pp.8-10] raises critical points regarding certain efforts in the field. Specifically, she directs her criticism towards works that draw comparisons between the ancient economy and other premodern economies, such as 17^th^ century England or 10^th^ century China, using methods that have received little scrutiny. Bowes argues that instead of relying solely on such comparisons, it is more valuable to focus on obtaining granular data at the household level. While Bowes' critique highlights the need for caution and a more nuanced approach in employing quantitative methods, it does not diminish the overall trend of increasing integration of these approaches in the study of ancient economies. Recent publications exemplify this integration by showcasing the use of quantitative methods in studying the Roman economy. For instance, the volume "Complexity Economics: Building a New Approach to Ancient Economic History" [@complexi2021] features case studies that employ network analysis and computational modelling to understand the complexities of the Roman economy. Similarly, the book "Simulating Roman Economies: Theories, Methods, and Computational Models" [@simulati2022] delves into the application of computational models to simulate and analyse Roman economic systems. These examples demonstrate the growing integration of quantitative approaches in the study of ancient economies, allowing researchers to explore the empirical dimensions of the Roman economy while also engaging with theoretical discussions. Despite their increasing integration into the economic debate, it is indeed true, as @bowes2021 [p.27] pointed out, that these new major textbooks often prioritize large-scale questions and run the risk of creating deterministic narratives that view the past through teleological lenses of "rise" and "fall." This limitation is perhaps inherent in computational modelling, which tends to focus on hypothesis testing and requires substantial data to construct narratives and contextualize the information historically. The need to make the reasoning behind causal inference more explicit when constructing models will be addressed in the subsequent discussion (§SIGNPOST HERE).

If the section began with an image depicting large estates worked by slaves in the Roman rural countryside (which we will revisit shortly), they were not the sole labour force involved. The post-war historical debate has placed increasing emphasis on the presence of other agents in the Roman rural landscape. In this context, the work of Karl Marx had for sure an impact in the popularity of bottom-up histories, as Eric @hobsbawmHistory1998 [pp.178-185] remarks. While slaves undoubtedly played a significant role especially in large-scale farming operations, agricultural activities encompassed a diverse range of individuals and groups. After all, traditional Roman texts consistently portray the image of a simple peasant working on a *fundus* to sustain his family. Free peasants involved in agricultural activities could take on different roles as either freeholders or tenants (*coloni*). Peter Garnsey, one of the historians who extensively studied peasants in the Classical age, mentions tenancy as "the most common method of production in the empire taken as a whole" [@garnseyCitiesPeasantsFood1998, p.94]. In fact, peasants were not limited to working on small-scale agricultural plots. They could also be involved in renting and cultivating both large and small estates. In his writings, the Roman agronomist Columella [-@columellaAgricultureThreeVolumes2010, pp.81-84] expresses criticism towards farmers who rent extensive parcels of land and neglect their responsibilities by leaving their servants in charge. He also disapproves of farmers who choose to reside in the town rather than overseeing their lands directly. Roman tenancy agreements, which are primarily known through the preserved Egyptian contracts, displayed a remarkable degree of diversity. These agreements encompassed various structures, ranging from short-term to long-term leases, and the methods of rent payment varied as well. If monetary payment was customary, sharecropping could be an alternative option for tenants. Sharecropping involved a fixed payment in kind, which provided tenants with some protection against market fluctuations. Sharecropping can be understood as an arrangement where tenants contribute a portion of their agricultural produce to the landlord instead of paying rent in cash. This practice mitigated the risks associated with market volatility, as the tenant and landlord shared the uncertainties of agricultural production together [@erdkamp2005, pp.26-29]. In a letter from 107 CE in Pliny the Younger's *Epistulae* [-@plinyEpistulaeCriticalEdition1962, p.301], it is clear how sharecropping increased risk not only for the tenant but also for the landlord, but it also encouraged long-term profitability. The sharing of risks and rewards created a mutually beneficial relationship between the tenant and the landlord. Sharecropping was particularly well-suited for capital-intensive arable farming, as suggested by Pieter W. @deneeveRomanLandownerHis1990. This includes the cultivation of cash crops like olives and grapes, which necessitated substantial investments. In addition to slaves and tenants, there were other types of labourers in the Roman rural countryside, which are rarely discussed in ancient sources. These included wage-earners, known as *mercenarii*, and debt-bondsmen, known as *obaerarii*. @varroAgriculture1934 [p.225], in his *De re rustica*, is informative on this matter:

> All agriculture is carried on by men --- slaves, or freemen, or both; by freemen, when they till the ground themselves, as many poor people do with the help of their families; or hired hands (*mercenarii*), when the heavier farm operations, such as the vintage and the haying, are carried on by the hiring of freemen; and those whom our people called *obaerarii* and of whom there are still many in Asia, in Egypt, and in Illyricum. With regard to these in general this is my opinion: it is more profitable to work unwholesome lands with hired hands than with slaves; and even in wholesome places it is more profitable thus to carry out the heavier farm operations, such as storing the products of the vintage or harvest.

Among these workers, the role of wage labourers is of particular interest. According to scholars like Peter @garnseyCitiesPeasantsFood1998, the significance of slavery in rural production may have been overstated. Both Paul Erdkamp [-@erdkamp2005, pp.80-83] and @garnseyCitiesPeasantsFood1998 [p.108] suggest that wage labourers were primarily found on large estates, where they would supplement the work of slaves during peak agricultural periods such as grain harvest and vintage. Wage labourers might not have constituted a distinct social class. Instead, they could also have been individuals who owned or rented their own farms and engaged in wage labour to earn additional income [@garnseyCitiesPeasantsFood1998, p.145]. K. D. White [-@whiteRomanFarming1970] estimates that dedicating 100 out of the 250 working days available to cultivating the land is adequate for subsistence farming. As a result, subsistence farmers would have approximately three months of available time for engaging in paid work. If small-scale farmers were not primarily focused on surplus production, they had the potential to offer additional labour. However, it is the large estates or villas that emerge as the most significant surplus producers for the market. The *villae rusticae*, which are believed to have originated in Thyrrenian Central Italy, specifically in regions such as Latium, northern Campania, and southern Tuscany (Etruria), are described in particular by Varro and Columella [@marzanoRomanVillasCentral2007]. Villas were characterized by their dual composition---a residential section (*pars urbana*) and a productive centre (*pars rustica*). The residential section was reserved for the landowner, while the latter served as the productive core of the villa, where slaves were dedicated to cultivating cash crops. Among these, grapes and olives held particular significance, as wine and olive oil could be transported over long distances. By the mid-1^st^ c. CE, it is estimated that there were seventy-one grape cultivars (varieties) and fifteen olive varieties in cultivation [@marzanoPlantsPoliticsEmpire2022, p.276]. These crops were not only labour-intensive, requiring a significant workforce especially during peak seasons, but also demanded substantial initial investments. To support the production of wine and olive oil, cellar rooms (*cellae vinariae* or *oleariae*) needed to be constructed to store the produce in buried containers known as *dolia defossa*. Further high costs resulted from other necessary facilities, including presses, floors, vats (*palmenti*) and additional related structures and equipment. Additionally, the harvest also needed to be protected from pests, such as caterpillars, mice, and foxes [@doddArchaeologyWineProduction2022; @hollanderFarmersAgricultureRoman2019, pp.27-28]. To appreciate the significance of such expenditure, one must take into account that the profitability of these investments frequently took several years to manifest: grapevines and olive trees typically reached their full productive capacity only after a decade of cultivation. Extensive research has been conducted on villas, resulting in a vast bibliography on the subject. What we can assert is that villas began to appear in the 2^nd^-1^st^ century BCE as large estates that specialized in cultivating specific cash crops, particularly olives and grapes for the production of olive oil and wine. The owners of these villas rarely engaged directly in agricultural work. Instead, they entrusted the daily management of the estate to a *vilicus* who oversaw the day-to-day affairs of the villa [@marconeStoriaAgricolturaRomana2004]. The subject of "slave villas" (*villa schiavistica*) has occupied much of the ongoing debate surrounding Roman agrarian history, and it continues to generate significant interest. Notably, the first scientific Italian excavation of a Roman site was the excavation of a villa in Southern Tuscany known as Settefinestre. Andrea @carandiniSettefinestreVillaSchiavistica1985, working within a Marxist framework, portrayed the villa as a plantation reminiscent of American colonial style, highlighting the significant role of slavery in the operation of these estates. The increased number of slaves following the Punic Wars (fought between 264 and 146 BCE) was a decisive factor in the expansion of villas, as it provided villa owners with a substantial labour force to work the lands. This was particularly significant considering the post-war decline in the population, which resulted in a decreased availability of citizens to engage in agricultural work due to their involvement in wars [@toynbeeHannibalLegacyHannibalic1965]. Furthermore, the eastward expansion during the late Republic and early Empire had a notable impact on the availability of slaves for agricultural labour. @carandiniSviluppoCrisiManifatture1981 suggested that these centuries mark a shift from Republican small-scale family-sized farms to profit-oriented large-estates. While it remains true that villas mainly employed a large amount of slaves in their production, a variety of free workers could have also been employed, especially when more workforce was required. When eventually Roman expansionism slowed down in the 2^nd^ c. CE, the resulting crisis in the availability of slaves pushed landowners towards other forms of management [@pinchetti2021, p.10]. In this period, the number of tenancy contracts increased significantly, with *coloni* leasing rural plots for short or long-term occupancy solutions, already discussed above.

In the previous paragraph, we discussed the development of *villae rusticae* and their exploitation of cash crops. Cash crops, particularly grapes and olives, were highly indicated for their market value and long-distance transportability. The selection of crops on any given farm was influenced by various factors, including economic considerations. Understanding why crop selection is important economically involves analysing choices such as selecting cereals over arboriculture and the specific type of cereal to cultivate. Multiple cereals can be chosen, or only one, each with different nutritional values, yields, and adaptability to different climates and geographies. Factors such as climate, soil quality, water availability, and geographic location must also be considered for the choice of cereal crops. Furthermore, crops have varying shelf lives, which affect their storage and marketability. When deciding which crops to cultivate, farmers take into account market demand, production costs, storage capabilities, and processing requirements. They assess the profitability of different crops based on factors like yield, market price, and input costs. For instance, farmers may choose between cash crops that yield immediate income, like grapes and olives mentioned earlier, which require significant investments but offer potential long-term returns. On the other hand, cereals serve as staple food crops but may have lower market value and profit margins. Within the cereal category, farmers must consider specific grain types. Some crops, like naked wheats, are less durable and more susceptible to damage from bacteria, fungi, and other pests during storage. Conversely, hulled wheats provide better protection but require additional processing, which adds to the production costs. Numerous crop selection models have been proposed for the Roman age, and a comprehensive overview is provided in @heinrichModellingCropSelectionRoman2017. One of the earliest scholars to discuss crop selection in the Roman era, albeit in different terms, was the economist Naum Jasny. Jasny's research on competition among grains in classical antiquity [-@jasnyWheatsClassicalAntiquity1944a; -@jasnyCompetitionGrainsClassical1942] compared different cereal taxa based on productivity, performance, geological adaptability, and economic factors. Notably, Jasny argued for a transition from emmer wheat (Triticum dicoccum) to hard wheat (Triticum durum) during the Roman age, which was completed in Late Antiquity. According to Jasny, hard wheat provided better yields and was more suitable for bread baking. Emilio Sereni, a historian and author of *Storia del paesaggio agrario Italiano* [-@sereniStoriaPaesaggioAgrario1961], provided a model specifically for Italy. Sereni also observed the shift towards hard wheat, but his approach was less evolutionistic compared to Jasny. Sereni argued that hulled wheats were inferior to naked wheats, while Jasny believed that the choice between naked and hulled wheats depended on specific circumstances. In his work, Sereni emphasized the strong correlation between crop selection and economic factors---during periods of economic growth, specialization occurred, whereas periods of depression led to greater crop diversity. In line with this perspective, Sereni argued that the number of cereal crops was higher in Republican Rome compared to the Imperial period, only to experience growth once again in Late Antiquity. This perspective contradicted Jasny's evolutionary viewpoint. In the 1980s, another significant contribution to crop selection models is found in the works of M.S. Spurr [-@spurrArableCultivationRoman1986; -@spurrCultivationMilletRoman1983]. Spurr responded to the perspectives put forth by Jasny and Sereni by arguing against the significance of climatic and geological factors in crop selection, emphasizing the overriding importance of economic considerations for peasants. According to Spurr's model, specialization would be the logical outcome of a thriving agricultural economy. However, this was not the case in Roman agriculture which was characterized by high diversification and by the use of 'minor' crops including millets. Robert @sallaresEcologyAncientGreek1991 also identified a transition from hulled to naked wheats in classical Greece, and argued that it was an unintentional process of crop improvement that originated in Neolithic times. Sallares challenged Jasny's perspective by suggesting that factors beyond cereal suitability criteria, such as demographic pressure, played a more significant role in the crop selection process. Furthermore, recent research conducted by Daphne @lentjesSubsistenceMarketExchange2013, focusing on several sites in southeast Italy occupied during the 1^st^ millennium BCE, revealed that while naked wheats became slightly more prevalent, other cereal taxa remained present without notable disappearance. Frits Heinrich's perspective on crop selection in the Roman era takes a more cautious approach, emphasizing the importance of precise archaeobotanical quantifications that go beyond simple presence/absence analyses. Heinrich highlights that crop selection was highly situational and influenced by factors such as market accessibility and taxation exemptions, particularly in the case of Roman Italy. The absence of taxation for Italian farmers provided them with greater freedom in choosing which crops to cultivate [@heinrichModellingCropSelectionRoman2017].

The scope of agricultural decision-making was not only limited to plants, but included also animals. The historian Geoffrey @kronRomanLivestockFarming2004, mostly basing on textual and zooarchaeological evidence, argued that convertible husbandry was a common practice in Roman times. Further hypotheses for this practice, based on archaeological evidence, can be found in *The Roman Peasant Project* [@bowesRomanPeasantProject2020], a series of excavations conducted between 2009 and 2014 in Southern Tuscany that specifically targeted peasant settlements. Convertible husbandry, also known as ley farming, involved a strategic allocation of arable land for both crop cultivation and pasture. Kron maintains that by implementing ley agriculture, peasants could optimize the productivity of their farms. The process of ley farming followed a productive regenerating cycle. Initially, certain plots of the farm are intensively cultivated with crops, such as cereals. Subsequently, these plots were sown with legumes, which served as nitrogen-fixing plants [@liuModelsBiologicalNitrogen2011]. Although ancient agronomists may not have fully understood the scientific basis behind this practice, they were aware of the positive effects of legumes on soil fertility, as writings by Cato and Columella suggest [@hollanderFarmersAgricultureRoman2019, p.30]. Support for the benefits of legumes can also be found in the works of Theophrastus [-@theophrastusEnquiryPlantsMinor1980, p.199], a Greek botanist who noted in his *Historia Plantarum* (written around the fourth to third century BCE) that beans seemed to have a fertilizing effect:

> Beans, as was said, are in other ways not a burdensome crop to the ground, they even seem to manure it, because the plant is of loose growth and rots easily.

Following the cultivation of legumes, the cultivated plots were set aside and utilized as pastures, known as leys, for a specific period of time. This rotational approach ensured that there was always a designated area available for livestock grazing. By allowing the land to rest and serve as pasture, farmers not only provided a source of food for their animals but also allowed for the regeneration of the soil. When selecting livestock, farmers took into account various factors, including economic considerations, resource availability, and market demand. They assessed the potential profitability and suitability of different livestock species based on their ability to yield meat, dairy, and other secondary products (e.g. wool, fat, etc.). While climatic conditions had a relatively smaller impact on animal selection compared to crop selection, it is true that certain environments are more conducive to raising specific species. For example, pigs were a versatile choice that could be raised almost anywhere. However, raising them in forested areas was economically advantageous due to the availability of acorns and other nuts, which served as a natural and abundant food source for pigs [@hollanderFarmersAgricultureRoman2019, p.34]. This utilization of local resources optimized the efficiency of livestock production and minimized the need for external inputs. The selection of animals for specific purposes, such as draught animals for agricultural work or specialized breeds for specific products like wool or milk, further exemplified the complexity of the selection process. In Roman times, cattle were the most common working animals, primarily utilized for traction in agricultural operations. Their main role was to provide the power necessary for plowing, pulling carts, and other tasks requiring heavy labour. However, cattle also served other purposes, including meat production, leather, and the utilization of their bones for various crafts and tools. The cattle husbandry sector experienced growth and specialization during this period, as evidenced by the significant increase in the average height of cattle during the Imperial age. Research conducted by @degrossimazzorinAnimaliRomaTre2022 [pp.70-71] provides insights into the changing characteristics of cattle in Rome. The study examined the average height at the withers, a key measurement in determining the size of quadrupeds. In the Republican phase, the average height was reported as 115.7 (N=9, SD=11.9), while during the Imperial phase, it increased to 129.4 (N=18, SD=6.2). This increase in height indicates a deliberate focus on breeding larger and stronger cattle, reflecting the demand for more efficient and powerful working animals. Certain regions of the peninsula specialized in cattle breeding. Areas such as Venosa, Sabina (north of Rome), southern Etruria, the Alps, and pre-Alps were known for their specialized cattle husbandry practices [@degrossimazzorinAnimaliRomaTre2022, p.68]. While larger estates had the means to sustain multiple working animals, small-scale peasants likely had to manage with just one. Alternatively, they might have resorted to renting or borrowing animals from neighbouring farmers on an as-needed basis. Farmers had to weigh the benefits and costs of different animal types to ensure optimal utilization of resources and maximize their economic returns. The interaction between crop selection and animal farming was intricately connected, as the availability and suitability of certain crops influenced the choice of livestock and vice versa. For example, the cultivation of specific crops like fodder or forage crops played a crucial role in providing feed for livestock and, as argued above, the by-products of animal farming, such as manure, were valuable resources for crop cultivation, contributing to the overall agricultural productivity. In addition to these considerations, various factors influenced the choice of animals to raise, similar to the selection process for plants. For example, pig meat was highly valued and likely in high demand during periods of population density. The Roman *suburbium*, with its proximity to the city of Rome, likely played a significant role in pig farming, as evidenced by numerous excavations reporting pigs as the most prevalent faunal remains. Specifically, the presence of certain cuts of pig meat suggests patterns of consumption [@degrossimazzorinAnimaliRomaTre2022].

### Late Roman Phase {style="text-align:justify;"}

Tracing the agrarian history of the late Roman period is a challenging task, primarily due to the inner limitations of ancient sources that predominantly inform us on the lives of the elite. The representation of the medium and small class of peasants in these sources is limited, hindering a comprehensive understanding of their experiences. Much of the available evidence often pertains to fiscal matters, leading historians to concentrate on topics such as slavery, wage labor, tenancy contracts, and the fate of what used to be the core of Roman large-scale agricultural production: the rural villa. Several studies have focused on explaining the transformations that took place in villas during the period from the 3^rd^ to the 5^th^ century. Beth @munroRecyclingDemandMaterials2012 identified three distinct phases in this phenomenon. The first phase, observed in the 3^rd^ century, reveals an overall decline in the number of villas. In the subsequent phase, occurring in the 4^th^ century, the surviving villas underwent a process of monumentalisation. This involved the enhancement and embellishment of existing structures, perhaps as a response to socio-political changes or the desire for ostentatious displays of wealth and status. The final phase, extending into the 5^th^ and 6^th^ centuries, witnessed a gradual abandonment of villas. This phase is characterized by a progressive disintegration of the once thriving villa culture, as various factors -- which will be examined shortly -- potentially contributed to the declining significance of villas during this period.

The focus on villas in the study of late empire agrarian history is primarily attributed to their prominent role as cash crop producers during the late Republic and early imperial phase, as described in the previous section. The significant contribution of villas to agricultural production during this period has led many scholars to speculate that the decline in the number of villas was linked to a decline in overall agricultural output. Support for this hypothesis can be found in ceramic findings, which indicate an increase in the prevalence of foreign imports. While wine exports may have experienced a decline in the late 1^st^ and early 2^nd^ centuries, the production of wine, a commodity closely associated with rural villas, continued to hold significance in Italy. However, there was a noticeable shift towards more localized wine production, as documented by Clementina @panellaAnforeItalicheII1989 and André @tcherniaVinItalieRomaine1986. The question of whether a crisis occurred during the late empire period is a subject of debate among scholars. Prominent archaeologists such as @carandiniVillaRomanaPiantagione1989 [p.130] argue for the occurrence of a crisis and destructuration during the Antonine age:

> The end of the second century brought to an end for Italy the chapter that had opened with the end of the Second Punic War and that had made the peninsula for the first time the economic centre of the world to the west of Mesopotamia. Some believe that this sad fate is limited to coastal Etruria. Let us leave this illusion to those who have no direct experience of the archaeological and agricultural landscapes of the other regions of central and southern Italy. It is possible that late antiquity, too, had its rationalities, beauties and riches in Italy, but as yet no one can tell us exactly where. So far are only clear the signs of the ruin and decay of the extraordinary *pomarium* that had been the Italy of villas.[^literature_review-1]

Those who argue for a crisis point to archaeological evidence such as the reorganization of villas into smaller quarters, poor repairs, and the functional repurposing of elegant rooms as signs of crisis in these settlements [@marzanoRomanVillasCentral2007, p.199]. On the other hand, Garnsey [-@garnseyRomanEmpireEconomy2014. pp.86-87] contends that there is insufficient evidence to support the notion of a crisis in wine production or agriculture during the 2^nd^ and early 3^rd^ centuries CE. Taking an intermediate stance, Domenico @veraDoniDiCerere2020 proposes that the crisis may have been exaggerated in historical literature and should be viewed more as a transformation. He challenges the simplistic dichotomy of decline versus prosperity and suggests that while certain localized areas, such as Thyrrenian Italy, experienced a crisis, other regions demonstrated signs of productive growth in the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ centuries, reaching their peak during the Constantinian period and beyond. Among these, northern Apulia, inland Sannio, and coastal Lucania. Vera's viewpoint aligns in this respect with Garnsey's, as the latter believes that the decline in villas was not ubiquitous or did not occur simultaneously in all regions. In southern Etruria the number of villas diminished during the Antonine period, but they were still productive in other areas in the 3^rd^ century---in *Latium* (around Rome), in the *ager Falernus*, and in southern Italy [@garnseyRomanEmpireEconomy2014, p.87; @lafonVillasItalieImperiale1994, p.221; @veraDoniDiCerere2020, p.221]. Vera also challenges the notion that a decline in viniculture automatically implies a general agricultural decline. He suggests that the changes observed may be attributed to a shift in production rather than a decline in overall agricultural output. Cereal and animal farming, for instance, do not show signs of decay [@corbierTranshumanceEntreSamnium1991; @spurrArableCultivationRoman1986]. The widespread abandonment of villas during this period can perhaps be understood in a different context. First, the progressive and widespread concentration of properties in the hands of senatorial families or of the imperial *fiscus* must have played a role in this process. Annalisa @marzanoRomanVillasCentral2007 [p.215] showed how some coastal and maritime villas during the mid-empire changed ownership and were transferred to the *fiscus* through testamentary legacies. These villas were probably not used anymore as a residential retreat since imperial slaves or freedmen were appointed as overseer of these properties. Second, the concentration and reorganization of properties often lacked geographical continuity, posing challenges to their management. Towards the end of the 3^rd^ century, forms of indirect tenancy increased, where plots of land were rented out to large tenants to large (*conductores*) and small tenants (*coloni*). Long-term rental contracts, known as *emphytheusis*, also became more common, continuing into the 4^th^ century, and primarily targeted imperial properties that had become too extensive to be effectively managed, rather than lands that had declined due to neglect [@whittakerRuralLifeLater1997, p.283]. @veraDoniDiCerere2020 [p.330] considers this period as a turning point in the Italian agricultural landscape. Villas, during this time, transformed into centres for the management of scattered plots of land and expanded their storage capacity for agricultural produce. For example, the villa in via Gabinia in Rome underwent modifications during the late imperial phase, including the addition of a long building identified as a storing facility [@marzanoRomanVillasCentral2007, p.213]. The concentration of properties during the late antique period did not always result in centralisation. Instead, a prominent agrarian structure that emerged during this time was the *massa fundorum*. It represents an agglomeration of properties with varying types, which may or may not have productive links between them [@veraMassaFundorumForme1999]. The reorganization of the rural landscape during this period also led to changes in the hierarchy of settlement patterns, resulting in a growing number of *pagi* and *vici*. These settlements were inhabited by peasants who worked the lands of the villas' *fundi* or *coloni*. The number of *vici* particularly increased in southern Italy, and many of these emerging *vici* were connected to territories previously occupied by villas. In some instances, they were even established in the locations of abandoned villas from the 2^nd^ to 3^rd^ centuries, with their maximum expansion occurring in the 4^th^ and 5^th^ centuries.

The transition to the colonate system may also have been fostered by the slave crisis of the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ centuries, which was indirectly caused by the reduction and slowdown of Roman military expansionism (Oliva, 1962). Karl Marx, a prominent proponent of what Kyle Harper [-@harperTransformationRomanSlavery2013, p.167] calls the "conquest thesis," argued for a larger availability of slaves in the later Republic due to expansionist wars. This idea was already proposed by David @humeEssaysMoralPolitical1987 earlier, in his essay 'On the Populousness of Ancient Nations'. The concept of increased slave labor driven by the demand for specific commodities, particularly wine, has been resilient in historiography and was embraced by neo-Marxists and modernist scholars such as Carandini [@harperTransformationRomanSlavery2013, p.169]. The slave crisis of the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ centuries cannot be solely attributed to the halt of Roman expansionism. The slave mode of production was already experiencing an internal crisis due to the inherent contradictions of the system, leading to rising supervising costs [@morleyMetropolisHinterlandCity1996]. The impact of the slave crisis varied across different regions, with a more pronounced effect in areas where slave-run villas were prevalent, such as Thyrrenian Italy [@marzanoRomanVillasCentral2007]. In contrast, northern Italy had a higher concentration of small and medium-sized farms and fewer slave-run villas [@ortalliFineVilleRomane1996]. Furthermore, it should be also considered that not all villas exclusively relied on slave labor, as discussed earlier. Many estates employed a combination of slave labor, hired seasonal workers, and tenants for their management [@marzanoRomanVillasCentral2007, p.229; @rathboneDevelopmentAgricultureAger1981]. The idea of a transition from slavery to a quasi-feudal mode of production has faced criticism from @harperTransformationRomanSlavery2013, who argues that Rome remained a slave society in the 4^th^ century and dismisses Vera's discussion of "slave tenancy" or "slave families" as an intermediate step towards colonate (and the medieval feudalism). He argues that these ideas are dependent on the Marxist 'conquest thesis' and fail to consider mechanisms of supply and demand and, more importantly, the labour market. According to the historian, the colonate is in fact a "historiographical myth" [@harperTransformationRomanSlavery2013, p.169]. The primary reason for the eventual decline of slavery that he indicates is instead the decrease in demand: "as the Roman imperial system unraveled, slavery became less prominent in precisely the two sectors that made Roman slavery exceptional: sub-elite households and agricultural estates" [@harperSlaveryLateRoman2011, p.66]. Unfortunately, this dissertation is unable to contribute directly to the ongoing debate surrounding the slave crisis and the transition to the colonate system, as proposing causal inferences using archaeological environmental analyses is challenging. However, it was essential to provide a background on the situation in the Italian countryside during this period, considering that much historiography has focused on this specific debate rather than exploring other topics (more related to this work) such as crop selection. What is important to note here is that if there was an economic depression during this period, it was not solely caused by the slave crisis. As highlighted by Chris @wickhamOtherTransitionAncient1984, the state coffers were already suffering from tax evasion by wealthy landowners. This factor, combined with other economic dynamics and factors at play, likely contributed to the overall economic conditions of the time.

The second phase in the transformation of villas, as identified by @munroRecyclingDemandMaterials2012, is the monumentalisation phase, which occurred around the 4^th^ century. During this period, many surviving villas underwent radical architectural and decorative transformations, particularly the residential ones. Simultaneously, there was a trend of abandonment for other villas. Numerous monumentalised villas were strategically located in fertile lands with panoramic views, often in proximity to main communication systems. Examples of such villas include Casteldebole (Bologna), Faragola (Apulia), Villa del Casale (Piazza Armerina, Sicily), Villa di Massenzio (on the via Appia, Lazio, an imperial residential villa monumentalised in the 4^th^ century), Desenzano sul Garda (Lombardy), and Masseria Ciccotti (Basilicata) [@sfameniVilleResidenzialiNell2006, p.28]. In some cases, the monumentalisation involved the restructuring of previously declining or abandoned villas from the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ centuries. For example, the new 4^th^-5^th^ century villa at S. Giovanni di Ruoti was installed on a previously abandoned building [@buckExcavationsSanGiovanni1994], and the same occurred with several farmsteads and minor villas in northern Apulia, where the productive areas were enhanced during the 4^th^-5^th^ centuries (Posta Crusta, La Minoia, Avicenna, and more) [@veraDallaVillaPerfecta1995, p.344]. Giuliano @volpeContadiniPastoriMercanti1996 explains the simultaneous rarefaction and growth of villas as a deliberate choice, with certain villas becoming the directional centres of land properties. This viewpoint is also shared by Vera [-@veraDallaVillaPerfecta1995, p.194], who believes that this process is part of a general transformation of the agrarian system. The monumentalisation of villas has been attributed to the increasing preference of elite members to reside in the countryside rather than in the city [@sfameniVilleResidenzialiNell2006, p.22]. The emergence of large villas, referred to as *praetoria*, between the 4^th^ and 5^th^ centuries in the Western part of the Roman Empire, has been linked to forms of self-representation by the elite [@lewitVanishingVillasWhat2003]. These villas indeed do not exhibit an organic relationship with the *pars rustica*. Further evidence of the aristocrats' increased urge for self-representation can be found in the letters of two writers of this period, Simmachus and Sidonius Apollinaris, which show the author's preoccupation with issues of power and reputation [@greyConstructingCommunitiesLate2011, pp.9-10]. The available documentation from this period has sparked debates among historians regarding the role of slavery in rural villas, part of which has already been discussed above. Vera [-@veraQuestioniDiStoria2012, p.112] is convinced that slavery was not a major component in Italian agricultural production at this point. Instead, these villas likely functioned as coordinating and stocking centres. For example, Villa del Casale in Sicily featured a large *horreum frumentarium* found near the entrance of the villa [@pensabeneVillaCasaleTerritorio2010]. The reorganisation of the countryside with sparser villas and the addition of stocking structures also suggests a shift in production from cash crops to cereal farming, according to Vera [@veraDoniDiCerere2020, p.231]. This transition is evident in locations such as Luni, where vineyards were abandoned on the hills while cereal farming persisted in the plains [@delanosmithLuniAgerLunensis1986]. Similarly, in Farfa, wine and olive fields appear to have been converted to cereal production [@leggioRicognizioneNeiDintorni1986].

In the fifth century, the residential villa model (*praetoria*) faced a crisis, albeit with varying modalities and timing in different regions [@sfameniVilleResidenzialiItalia2012]. One notable characteristic of these villas is the presence of re-use and recycling phases, indicating a continuity of occupation that extends into the early medieval period [@munroRecyclingDemandMaterials2012, p.353]. The presence of squatters in these abandoned villas has been hypothesized, although this notion is highly debated in more recent literature [@munroRecyclingDemandMaterials2012; @munroOrganizedRecyclingRoman2020; @castroraobarbaFineVilleRomane2020]. A revising process of the traditional paradigm of decline -- a decline that Bryan @ward-perkinsFallRomeEnd2006 [pp. 87-169] could see so clearly in the material and housing culture of Late Antiquity -- has been promoted by Tamara Lewit [-@lewitVanishingVillasWhat2003; -@lewitVillasFarmsLate2004, pp.256-260; -@lewitBonesBathhouseReevaluating2005] who described the transformation of the villas as a result of the different cultural and ideological values of the élite after their conversion to the Christian religion. Additionally, @volpeAbitatoAltomedievaleDi2009 suggest that the structural changes observed in former Roman villas are not solely a result of different values but are influenced by various factors, including the Gothic War, the crisis of central power in Rome, and other elements contributing to the aristocracies' impoverishment. However, it is important to keep in mind an important datum: the frequency of villa re-use is relatively low compared to the number of abandoned settlements. Angelo @castroraobarbaContinuitaTopograficaDiscontinuita2014 \[p.264\] demonstrates that only 26% of Italian villas were reused out of a total of 1,850 case studies. Considering the extensive debate surrounding the structural changes in villas during this period, it is important to mention that this dissertation does not delve into that specific topic. For more comprehensive insights, readers are encouraged to refer to seminal works by @brogioloFineVilleRomane1996a, @brogioloDopoFineVille2005, @castroraobarbaFineVilleRomane2020, @christieLandscapesChangeRural2004, @doddConceptualFrameworkApproaching2019, and @ripollTransformationEndRoman2000. Importantly, research has shown how the chronology of the abandonment of Italian villas is not homogeneous. While Thyrrenian Italy seems to be the first to be in decadence, where territories are abandoned along with a demographic crisis [@veraDoniDiCerere2020, p.330], in Southern Italy, for instance, villas seem to be in use at least until the 6^th^ -- 7^th^ century. The reasons for this longer prosperity are manifold and complex. Carla Sfameni [-@sfameniVilleResidenzialiNell2006, p.167] asserts that the emergence of large residential buildings in the south in the 4^th^ century has to indicate a positive economic trend already in the 3^rd^ century. She criticizes the pre-1950s historiography that saw an agricultural and economic decline of southern Italy and Sicily during the imperial age, which worsened in the late imperial period. Later work by F. De Robertis [-@derobertisSulleCondizioniEconomiche1951; -@derobertisProsperitaBanditismoNella1972] and by Lelia @craccorugginiEconomiaSocietaNell1995 reevaluated southern economy suggesting opposite trends, especially for cereal farming in Apulia. Much of this positive growth has been attributed to the diversion of *annona* coming from Egypt to the new capital, Constantinople in the early fourth century. At this time, Italy needed a new productive centre for cereal distributions. Northern Africa, Sicily, and Apulia were obvious choices, given the large amount of available plains, and started exporting large quantities of grain [@volpeContadiniPastoriMercanti1996]. Vera [-@veraDoniDiCerere2020, p.330] hypothesized that the state did not promote specialisms in certain areas, rather it required produce from where there was already an abundance. Northern Apulia, notably the endpoint of a transhumance circuit, also became a core centre of wool production. *Lucania et Bruttii*, hosting a wide forested area, became large producers of pig. Calabria and Sicily were producing *vina fiscalia* (wine destined to the free imperial distributions to citizens). The destination of Apulian grain is debated, as probably until the 5^th^ century the *annona* on southern Italy was only related to wine and pork production, while the grain from Apulia must have been destined to the Danube military region or Cisalpina, areas that are easy to reach on the Adriatic maritime route. Whatever the destination, this southern prolonged prosperity opened up the doors for senatorial investments. The area was more secure, a central place in the Mediterranean, close to infrastructures and Rome itself, not to mention the fact that investing in agricultural produce (especially cereals) was a good strategy in times of monetary inflation [@sfameniVilleResidenzialiNell2006, p.168-169].

Late antique historians have historically focused less on the topic of peasant societies, with the scholarly debate primarily centered around slaves and *coloni*, as mentioned earlier. The literary sources available from this period often present images of the elite, providing limited insights into the lives of small-scale peasants. At present, the most valuable source of information regarding the experiences of peasants in late antiquity can be found in the papyrological evidence from Egypt. These documents, such as petitions and legal records, offer glimpses into the lives of peasants, albeit with potential biases and limitations in terms of representativeness. In particular, the nature of these records can skew our perspective in favor of interpreting peasants in subaltern positions, as they often highlight conflicts, disputes, and struggles [@greyConstructingCommunitiesLate2011, pp.4-7]. One notable historiographical work that specifically examines the late Roman peasantry is Cam @greyConstructingCommunitiesLate2011's "Constructing Communities in the Late Roman Countryside." The book explores the concept of "small politics," emphasizing the networks of mutual support and social dynamics within peasant societies that are often overlooked in fiscal documents. Grey's research highlights the agency of peasants, as they adeptly navigate and negotiate against aristocratic claims, particularly in the western regions. While the book primarily focuses on the social and political aspects of peasant life, it does not delve into farming strategies. Instead, it centres on legal disputes and litigations to discuss the intricate dynamics within these communities. Archaeological projects that directly target peasant and non-elite pathways, as was the case in 'The Roman Peasant Project' [@bowesRomanPeasantProject2020], are still missing in late antique archaeology. As a result, explicit crop selection models specific to this period have not been extensively developed. Nonetheless, scholars acknowledge a general shift from cash crops to cereal farming during this era. However, the precise pathways, timing, and spatial patterns of this agricultural transition remain unclear. Additionally, there is a lack of comprehensive, peninsula-wide perspectives on stock raising during the late antique period. While some regional studies, particularly focused on northern Apulia [@volpeContadiniPastoriMercanti1996; @volpeLanePecorePastori2012; @buglioneDalTavoliereAlle2015; @buglioneAgricolturaAllevamentoNella2016], provide insights into specific areas, there is a dearth of comprehensive synthesis works that encompass the entirety of the late Roman period.

### The Early Medieval phase and the 11^th^ century {style="text-align:justify;"}

If late antique historians have focused on questions of slavery, tenancy, and landownership, two broad conflicting opinions have dominated the post-1950 discourse on the post-classical landscape. The first stresses continuities with the former Roman and late Roman structures and economic system, and the other emphasizes dramatic rupture from said systems. Pierre @toubertStructuresLatiumMedieval1973 was among the first to argue for continuities in settlement patterns until the 10^th^-11^th^ century CE, when sources begin to describe new types of fortified settlements called *castelli* or *castra*. Toubert [-@toubertStructuresLatiumMedieval1973, pp.321-338] used textual sources to outline the evolution from 'dispersed households' of the 6^th^-7^th^ century CE (*casalia*), to 9^th^ century CE manors (*curtes*), culminating in 10^th^-11^th^ century CE castles (*castelli*). The opinion that castles originated from *curtes* is also shared by the historian Vito Fumagalli, who in turn believes that manors developed especially in Northern Italy in the Carolingian period (1980, p.318). After centuries of alleged uncultivated standstill, the *incastellamento* (the process of creation of castles) made an agricultural revival possible, with new lands beginning to be cultivated around castles [@toubertStructuresLatiumMedieval1973, pp.157-198]. The scholarly focus on continuity *vis-à-vis* rupture also intersected with the study of the economic history in this period. Henri @pirenneMohammedCharlemagne2008 provided a long-lasting contribution to this matter in his work "Mohammed and Charlemagne", which looked at documentary sources (primarily related to traders) and numismatic evidence. Pirenne argued against the traditional view on the end of Classical civilization, which overemphasizes the impact of 4^th^-6^th^ century CE Germanic migrating tribes. Pirenne [-@pirenneMohammedCharlemagne2008, pp.54-70] claimed that such tribes could not have had a fundamental impact on Roman-style institutions and trading connections, extending the life of the Classical world up to the 7^th^ century CE. He argued that life on the countryside and systems of agriculture remained the same. In this model, even the great Roman estates survived [@pirenneMohammedCharlemagne2008, pp.75-76]. Indeed, the literary sources point us to a continuity not only in assets in some cases, but also in the attitudes held by the ruling class. An example of a particularly well-known landowner in the records of the age of Theodoric, Ostrogoth king, is Theodad, his nephew. Theodad owned an extensive *massa fundorum* which was concentrated in Tuscia. The administration of his estates was carried out through the use of *actores* who were responsible for collecting rents and delivering them to him. This method of administration, as well as Procopius' somewhat hostile portrayal of Theodad, suggests a continuation of the patterns observed within the senatorial class of the late Roman period [@veraDoniDiCerere2020, p.208]. The traditional view of the postclassical countryside as a landscape destroyed by continuous instabilities and warfare also continued to be challenged by recent scholarship. Arnold H. M. Jones (1964, p. 25) wrote that "the destruction caused by continued civil wars and barbarian invasions must have been immense. Cities were sacked and burned, crops destroyed, cattle driven off, and the population carried away into slavery." However, as Tamara Lewit (2004, p.41) points out, only a few literary sources mention destruction to agriculture in this period. Cities were likely the primary target of such violent acts.
As was anticipated in the previous section, archaeologists had a different perspective on the transitional landscape and economy at the time of the collapsing villa system and Germanic migrations. The archaeological discourse emphasises that textual sources can include bias and that scholars should give more consideration to material evidence such as ceramics, settlement patterns, and architecture. For example, Bryan @ward-perkinsFallRomeEnd2006 recognised the decline of living standards during the late Antique period through the abundance of coarse pottery/wooden houses, and the disappearance of coinage for everyday use. Chris @wickham2005 [pp.730-735] also reports a "ceramic breakdown" and deterioration of exchange systems between the 6^th^ and late 9th century CE, when standardized pottery types mostly disappear and only local productions survive [@brogioloFineVilleRomane1996; @giordaniVasellameFineMensa1994]. Finally, Richard Hodges and David Whitehouse [-@hodgesMohammedCharlemagneOrigins1983, pp.36--48] determined, using survey data, a decline in the number of datable sites throughout Italy and a demographic decrease between the beginning of the 5^th^ and the end of the 6^th^ century CE. Fabio Giovannini (2010, pp.218-9) also argues for a demographic stagnation from the 6th century until the 12^th^-13^th^ century, and reports no prolonged famines or epidemics from the 8^th^ to the 14^th^ century. During this period, the demographic pressure was low, particularly in rural areas. Various factors contributed to this decline. While traumatic events may have had an immediate impact on population numbers, their long-term effects are usually limited. Other factors, such as an extended period of breastfeeding for children (from 4-8 months in the Roman era to up to 2 years in the medieval period), likely influenced the number of children in rural communities. In the Roman era, it is estimated that rural families had an average of six children, whereas from the 4^th^ to the 6^th^ century, the average must have been around three (Ibid. 230). Despite the decrease in population, osteological analyses indicate an improvement in nutrition and diet, with fewer skeletons displaying pathologies related to these factors. Giovannini (CITE) attributes this improvement to a more diverse subsistence diet compared to the Roman era. This aspect will be further explored later in this chapter. While Giovannini suggests stagnation until the 12^th^ century, Di Muro (2020, 13-14) argues for an increase in population around the time of Liutprand, the king of the Lombards, in the 8^th^ century, following the plagues and conflicts that occurred during the Justinian era.
In a *status quaestionis* on the discipline of Medieval Archaeology in Italy, Marco Valenti [-@valentiArcheologiaCampagneAltomedievali2014, p.123] stated that the debate was monopolized in the 1990s by the "Tuscan model" because of the larger availability of archaeological data from this region. The "Tuscan model" was put forth by archaeologists Riccardo Francovich and Hodges [-@francovichVillaVillageTransformation2003, p.21], who argued that Toubert's textual model was flawed because a break had already occurred in the 6^th^-7^th^ century CE, when peasant communities moved to hilltop locations and created fenced farms. The model posits that the choice of hilltops was probably dictated by necessity because after the Greek-Gothic war, unconstrained farmers decided to cluster for protection. Only later, under Carolingian rule, did villages develop hierarchies and become *curtes*. Lastly, the phenomenon of *incastellamento* in the 10^th^-11^th^ century CE, merged manorial functions with landscape management [@valentiArcheologiaCampagneAltomedievali2014, pp.130-131]. The "Tuscan Model" clashed with the idea (popularized by Marc Bloch [-@blochFrenchRuralHistory1966, pp.1-5]) that Roman villas were at the root of modern villages [@cheyetteDisappearanceAncientLandscape2008, p.129]. Following the intensification of excavations in the late 1990s, the "Tuscan model" received criticism, especially by Gian Pietro Brogiolo, who considered the case of Tuscany as an anomaly, because in Tuscany aristocratic weakness facilitated the creation of hilltop villages by free-moving farmers [@valentiArcheologiaCampagneAltomedievali2014, pp.131-135]. In 2004, there was a confrontation between the two sides of this debate when Francovich, Brogiolo and Valenti held an unpublished conference in Poggibonsi titled "Scavi fortunati e invisibilità archeologica" [@insegnamentodiarcheologiamedievaleedellaltomedioevoScaviFortunatiInvisibilita2004]. The title was chosen polemically after Brogiolo defined the excavations in Tuscany as circumstantially "lucky" because the structured network of Tuscan settlements must have complemented centres of power. Francovich opened the heated discussion by stating that Toubert's continuity model (still supported by Brogiolo and other scholars) was merely based upon documentary evidence from about eight castles dated around the 10^th^ century CE. According to Francovich, a small piece of land in Tuscany could provide better information than the entire work of Toubert [@valentiMargineAlleCampagne2009, pp.40-42; @valentiArcheologiaCampagneAltomedievali2014, pp.132-136]. Recently, the picture seems clearer because of historical and archaeological comparative work in the Italian peninsula. It now seems that the role of monastic foundations in the control of the countryside is undeniable because these institutions were more open to economic exchanges and agricultural exploitation than other aristocratic landowners, who were more interested in a military control of the landscape. Monasteries were often connected to a vast network of *curtes*, which were large tracts of land divided into two parts: the *dominicum* and the *pars massaricia*. The *dominicum* referred to the administrative and residential area of the estate, while the *pars massaricia* designated the portion dedicated to free or semi-free peasants. The origin of *curtes* is a subject of debate among scholars. Some argue for continuities with the Roman villa-system, while others, as mentioned earlier, propose a significant shift in landownership patterns (CITE: Hodges?). However, a detailed discussion of this topic is beyond the scope of this chapter. What is important to note is that during the Lombard period, both the southern and northern duchies (although most well-studied sources are from Tuscany) provide examples of large manors already featuring a division between *dominicum* and *pars massaricia*. The exact size of such estates remains uncertain, although a *curtis* could be valued at up to 8,000 *solidi*, as seen in the case of the 8^th^ century *curtis* of Alfiano sull'Oglio (Brescia). Nonetheless, most historians agree that the *curtes* became more structured and widespread during the Frankish era. Wickham argues that Lombard *possessores* were economically weaker compared to their Frankish counterparts. However, Di Muro points out that while most of the known Lombard *curtes* from documentary sources were private, the Carolingian estates studied so far mostly belonged to the royal *fiscus*. Wickham's perspective notwithstanding, there are other historians, such as Bruno Andreolli and Massimo Montanari (CITE), who highlight how corvées (unpaid labor obligations) fully developed during the Frankish period. Indeed, the demands made by landlords on peasants during the Lombard age were much more vague and general. In their view, corvées serve as indicators of a stronger control exerted by landlords over the manor. Towards the end of the Lombard era, we find references to the *operae* (labour) that free peasants had to perform for their landlords, as seen in the case of Totone di Campione (CITE Gasparri). Although rare, there are instances of Lombard peasant obligations, which are less likely to be recorded since much of the information we have on Carolingian *curtes* comes from polyptychs (documents that describe the lands and possessions of a landlord), which were not used during the Lombard age (Di Muro, p.24). 
The role of monastic foundations in the network of *curtes* becomes evident when examining examples from the southern Lombard duchy of Benevento. One notable complex is Santa Sofia di Benevento, established around 760 CE by Duke Arechi II (CITE). In 774 CE, the duke bestowed upon the *coenobium* numerous lands and productive activities, including the saltpans of *Salpi* (Apulia), a wood collection forest in Ascoli Satriano, a chalk mine in Nurano, various animal farms, and more (CITE: see Di Muro, pp. 39-40). Among the properties donated to Santa Sofia was the former Roman villa of Faragola (Apulia), which underwent reorganization in the mid-7^th^ century to enhance production and optimize spatial arrangement, particularly in handling farm produce (CITE). Situated on the road to Benevento, it is likely that some of its goods were destined for that city.
Study of material culture suggests that the date of economic development in the Italian countryside should sit at around the 8^th^-9^th^ century CE [@valentiArcheologiaCampagneAltomedievali2014, p.138], which coincides with the late Lombard and Frankish age. In 2001, Jean-Pierre Devroy [-@devroeyEconomy2001, p.97] hypothesized that between the 5^th^ and 11^th^ century CE, ninety percent of the Italian population was living in a subsistence economy in the countryside. In general, though, the topic of rural economy is sparse in historical and archaeological literature. As Fredric Cheyette [-@cheyetteDisappearanceAncientLandscape2008, pp.127-129] noted, only one volume in the series titled "The transformation of the Roman world" [@barceloMakingFeudalAgricultures2004] is devoted to the rural economy. The neglect of rurality by historians and archaeologists is partially to be ascribed to a "primitivism approach"[^literature_review-2] [@castilloAgrarianArchaeologyEarly2014, p.2], which is still significant in southern European academia. This approach argues for the return to a simpler form of economy and that this simplification is what brought on other changes in the early medieval social structure. Wickham [-@wickham2005, p.534], in talking about peasant autonomy, made an interesting point about agricultural production in the framework of the "Tuscan model". Wickham claimed that after the 5^th^ century CE, peasants did indeed operate in small circles of subsistence economy, but they had acquired more autonomy and responsibilities in farming production than in Roman times. Peasants were liberated of former farming priorities, such as generating a surplus for taxation, and thus they did not have to meet external demands any longer. I will now outline these former farming priorities to contextualize this statement. During the Late Roman Empire, between the rule of Septimius Severus and Diocletian, most of the Roman soldier salary (*stipendium*) was converted into wheat provisions (Carrié 1993, 100). The state secured this distribution of grain to the soldiers (*annona militaris*) by taxing in kind the farmers. In times of peace, farmers would have been refunded of these wheat requisitions. However, in case of military necessities (as most of the times during the Late Roman age) the requisitions acted as a form of taxation (Ibid., 101--102). The aforesaid concept of late antique peasant autonomy remained constant until the manor system was fully implemented in the 8^th^ century CE. Adriaan Verhulst (1966) had already demonstrated the late origins of the manor system in France, but Wickham (2005, 280--281) argued for the presence of manors in Northern Italy and Tuscany as well.

[
In the previous sections, we discussed the importance of crop selection models in understanding peasant choices and the subsequent economic consequences. Although explicit crop selection models are still missing for the postclassical Italian countryside, the subject has been discussed by historians more for this period when compared to the late roman phase. In particular, the discussion has especially focused around Tuscany, where many agrarian contracts have been studied, and Northern Italy in general, where there are more available archaeobotanical analyses. Two scholars have been particularly prominent on this topic--- Bruno Andreolli and Massimo Montanari. 
Andreolli (1981) studied 8^th^-10^th^ century agrarian contracts, reporting over 500 documents for Tuscany, most of which are from 9^th^ century Lucca. Out of these 500 contracts, 195 mention some sort of payment in kind with foodstuffs, either of vegetable or animal origin. For cereal and legumes, two types of payment are mentioned in the sources---a fixed and a partial quota. The former refers to a fixed weighted amount of produce, while the second is typically one third of the total. According to Andreolli, partial quotas are typical of plains, which were dedicated to cereal farming, whereas fixed quotas are typical of mountains, hills, and less productive areas. For instance, in the area of Garfagnana and Lunigiana the contracts from Sillano, Gorfigliano, and Cascio [Footnote: One contract from Cascio reports a partial quota amounting to ¼ of the total.] report fixed quotas. Examples of partial quotas appear in most of the 9^th^-10^th^ century polyptychs from the monasteries of San Colombano di Bobbio and Santa Giulia di Brescia (Montanari 1979, pp. 166-172). The preference for partial quotas in contracts for the most productive areas is also evidenced by the most common product in the contracts, wine. Wine is always requested in the form of a partial quota, often half of the production. Next to wine, olives also appear, always commonly requested as half. It is significant that olives are not requested in the form of oil, but always as a raw material, probably for reasons of necessity. Indeed, it is possible to assume that not all farmers possessed olive presses. In addition to these products, chestnuts, hay, acorns, and other foodstuff was requested. The payment of animals in contracts is often vague in contracts, especially in the Lombard period, where the type of animal is often not specified. Other times, specific animals are mentioned---pigs, goats, sheep, cows, and chickens. In many of these cases the animal had to be 'annotino', i.e. one year old. In the transition from the 8^th^ to the 9^th^ century, contracts became more specific, requiring only specific parts of the pig, such as the shoulder. In the 10^th^ century these forms of payment in kind seem to fade away, probably as a form of abandonment of 'old' Lombard practices. More generally, Andreolli sees arboriculture as the real novelty of the early Middle Ages in Italy. According to the historian, cereal farming in this period was not very productive and the drive towards innovation and improved yields was minimal. In other words, while historiography has focused on cereals as the fundamental productive component of early medieval agrarian systems, orchards have often been ignored and the judgement on the agriculture of this period could only have been negative. The importance of the orchard is also understandable in view of the growing importance of urban gardens in this period. Recently, early medieval historiography is increasingly focusing on this topic, both in Italy and elsewhere (CITE). In the early Middle Ages, the word *hortus* could refer to various situations: urban or suburban gardens, gardens in the dominical part of a *curtis*, and monastic gardens. Contrary to more pessimistic theses that read the progressive ruralisation of cities as a sign of decay compared to the Roman age, the spread of vegetable gardens in the early Middle Ages can instead be read in terms of economic rationale and practicality. Firstly, documentation especially from northern and central Italy explicitly states that vegetable gardens are not subject to taxation. The only exception to this rule were legumes, which were subject to taxation as they were regularly cultivated in the fields. Among the most requested legumes in this period, faba beans were often indicated in the taxes and agrarian contracts from S. Giulia di Brescia, Lucca, and Verona (Andreolli 1990, pp.184-185). Caroline Goodson (2021) in her recent work on early medieval urban gardens has pointed out that the greater diffusion of kitchen gardens in postclassical Italian cities is not a symptom of decadence, but rather a sign of a different way to conceive urban spaces. The transition from the unproductive and ornamental gardens of the Roman era to intensively cultivated *horti* denotes the utilitarian mentality of early medieval man. The increased availability of space in the cities, a safer and more accessible food supply, and investment in fruit plants in the medium and long term all contributed to this phenomenon. Urban gardens spread in Rome (especially between the 6^th^ and the 8^th^ century), Lucca, Naples, Ferrara, Verona, and other cities. One of the scholars who has been most concerned with agricultural practices and diet in the early Middle Ages, implicitly formulating models of peasant cultivation is Montanari. Most of his observations are based on documents from northern Italy, and he is among the historians who have most popularised the idea of polyculture in the early Middle Ages.

Overall, past archaeological literature has contributed to our understanding of the early medieval rural dynamics, but the integration with different types of archaeological sources can improve this picture.

-	Ruralisation of cities (Andreolli 1980, Goodson)
-	Incolto: Wood exploitation?
o	Three actors in the uncultivated areas:
	The state
	Landlords
	Users
-	More explicit models for other European countries: France, Belgium, UK, …
-	Devroey, la nature et le roi

## Environmental archaeology approaches in Italian archaeology

Maybe move the processual arch. part somewhere here or create a general 'science in arch' section

-   Environmental sub-fields as archaeobotany and zooarchaeology have allowed to fact-check some assumption about food consumption in the Classical age that most of the times were not true, or the reality was not so black or white.

-   Autoecological vs Synecological approaches

-   How does Env.Arch. position itself in the agricultural economy debate?

    -   First approaches in italy and move to archaeobotany and zooarch.
        -   Review and synthesize relevant studies, scholarly articles, and research findings that address each theme or topic.
        -   Maybe put here the existing bibliographical collections, specific studies on 'minor' grains, specific studies on livestock farming
    -   Identify the main theories, methodologies, and approaches used in previous research.
    -   Highlight the strengths, limitations, and gaps in the existing literature.

For the bias in the archaeobotanical research in Italy read Heinrich 2017

Neolithic founder crops -\> history of agrarian evolution in Italy?

Discuss this: "However, both disciplines are slowly coming of age in Italy. The first important steps in this process were taken in the 1970s and early 1980s, when archaeobotanical research concentrated on the need to catalogue the finds, and create a general image of the available species (e.g. Castelletti 1972; 1976; Follieri 1971; 1973; 1975; LaCroix Phippen 1975; Hjelmqvist 1977; Barker 1977; Follieri and Coccolini 1979; Costantini 1979; 1980; 1983a; 1983b; 1983c; Scali 1983; Steele 1983)." from: Groot, M., Lentjes, D., Zeiler, J.

## Research framework: Statistics in Archaeology

General introduction (from @shennanQuantifyingArchaeology1997 ?)

In archaeology, multivariate statistics has been applied since the mid-60s, when the spread of computers and statistical packages made these methods more easily applicable. The growing popularity of computational archaeology in this period also owes a great debt to the New Archaeology movement (or Processual archaeology). New Archaeology emphasized the application of rigorous scientific analysis at the expense of the cultural historical approach which focused on artifacts cataloging based on ethnic grouping (@binfordNewPerspectivesArchaeology1968).

Include Baxter and Drennan

-   Discuss the rationale for using a multi-source archaeological study, integrating environmental proxies such as animal and plant remains.
-   Explain the significance of using a Bayesian approach to multilevel modeling and the application of beta-binomial models for data analysis.
-   Justify the use of the selected datasets and the importance of a holistic approach.
-   A limit is that most studies use qualitative rather than quantitative approaches in economy [@theprod2001]
