## Introduction

Intro to chapter

## The Roman Agricultural Economy

::: callout-alert
Should I divide the economy and agriculture sections?
:::

-   The primitive economy or the modern one?

-   State investment and production (Erdkamp - The grain market)

-   The cash crops: wine and olive oil. Introduce Roman villas here. Good work from Marzano.

-   Cite Kron's works here?

## Late Roman Phase: Continuity or Rupture?

-   Introduce debates on the transformation of the Roman world as opposed to 'collapse'.

-   Villas transformation

-   Cite @scottGrainDeepHistory2017, and @squatritiWeedsCarolingiansEmpire2022 [p. 36] for the "grain states"

## Studies on early Medieval economy

-   Write about urban gardens here?

-   Maybe cite @andreolliRuoloOrticulturaFrutticultura1990

## Studies on Medieval economy

-   The 11th century, the incastellamento, the agricultural revival.

## Environmental archaeology

Maybe move the processual arch. part somewhere here or create a general 'science in arch' section

-   Environmental sub-fields as archaeobotany and zooarchaeology have allowed to fact-check some assumption about food consumption in the Classical age that most of the times were not true, or the reality was not so black or white.

-   Autoecological vs Synecological approaches

### Archaeobotany {style="text-align:justify"}

::: callout-important
## Section in progress {style="text-align:justify;"}

Moved the introduction to archaeobotany in methods. Here I should explain the advancement of archaeobotany in classical and medieval archaeology, why it has been used, the databases for Italy and Europe, etc..
:::

Early practitioners...

Macroremains were also the first plant fossils to be studied in archaeology in the 19th century [@lodwickArchaeobotanicalResearchClassical2022].

For palinology: @lechterbeckExploringPotentialPalynology2020

For the bias in the archaeobotanical research in Italy read Heinrich 2017

Neolithic founder crops -\> history of agrarian evolution in Italy?

Discuss this: "However, both disciplines are slowly coming of age in Italy. The first important steps in this process were taken in the 1970s and early 1980s, when archaeobotanical research concentrated on the need to catalogue the finds, and create a general image of the available species (e.g. Castelletti 1972; 1976; Follieri 1971; 1973; 1975; LaCroix Phippen 1975; Hjelmqvist 1977; Barker 1977; Follieri and Coccolini 1979; Costantini 1979; 1980; 1983a; 1983b; 1983c; Scali 1983; Steele 1983)." from: Groot, M., Lentjes, D., Zeiler, J. (Eds.), 2013. Barely surviving or more than enough? the environmental archaeology of subsistence, specialisation and surplus food production. Sidestone Press, Leiden. \[PAGE 104\]

Soil types vs Crops

see Rippon et al 2015, p. 81 as a comparison for results and Lodwick chapter in Hamerow and McKerracher 2022, p. 153

### Zooarchaeology

Classical intro with name zooarchaeology vs archaeozoology

## Landscape studies

## Diet studies

Meat consumption: Have a look at Kron Geoffrey. Roman Livestock Farming in Southern Italy : the Case against Environmental Determinism . In: Espaces intégrés et ressources naturelles dans l'Empire romain. Actes du colloque de l'Université de Laval - Québec (5-8 mars 2003) Besançon : Institut des Sciences et Techniques de l'Antiquité, 2004. pp. 119-134. (Collection « ISTA », 939); -\> Pages 122-123

Probably introduce isotopes here

It might be good also to cite [@heinrichRomanIsotopesEconomic2021]

## Big data in archaeology

## Statistical analysis in archaeology

General introduction (from [@shennanQuantifyingArchaeology1997] ?)

In archaeology, multivariate statistics has been applied since the mid-60s, when the spread of computers and statistical packages made these methods more easily applicable. The growing popularity of computational archaeology in this period also owes a great debt to the New Archaeology movement (or Processual archaeology). New Archaeology emphasized the application of rigorous scientific analysis at the expense of the cultural historical approach which focused on artifacts cataloging based on ethnic grouping (@binfordNewPerspectivesArchaeology1968).

Include Baxter and Drennan

## Conclusions

Conclusions to chapter and link to next chapter

## Something that I might need to explore or add:

-   Agriculture in Roman Italy: what are the main consequences? Is there any link between agricultural shifts and movement of settlements?

-   Continuity in field system

-   Is there an early medieval agricultural shift? Or Medieval? Consequences in terms of settlement patterns? more villages? more cities?

-   Crop deposits: Where do they exist? Do they indicate monoculture or crop rotation? (This shouldnt be in the lit review of course). Hamerow and McKerracher.

    -   No database for these.
    
    
# Proposed structure

1. Introduction to the Literature Review:
   - Provide an overview of the importance and relevance of studying the patterns of subsistence, economy, and environmental change in relation to regional patterns of Italian peasantry in the 1st millennium CE.
   - Clearly state the research objectives and questions that guide your literature review.

2. Background Information:
   - Provide a brief historical and contextual background of the transition from Late Antiquity to the early Middle Ages in Italy.
   - Discuss the existing scholarly debate and gaps in knowledge regarding the dynamics of human-nature interaction during this period.
   - Highlight the significance of understanding agricultural practices, economic structures, and environmental change in this historical context.

3. Themes or Topics:
   - Identify and discuss key themes or topics relevant to your research objectives. These may include:
     - Roman economic structures and farming practices during Late Antiquity.
     - Political, demographic, and climatic changes and their impact on agricultural strategies.
     - Peasants' adaptive strategies and coping mechanisms.
     - Role of political organization, economy, culture, and environment in shaping agricultural regimes and animal/plant husbandry selection.
     - Influence of elite contexts and high-status transactions on the interpretation of agricultural production.
     - Regional variations in agricultural strategies and production frameworks.

4. Synthesis of Existing Studies:
   - Review and synthesize relevant studies, scholarly articles, and research findings that address each theme or topic.
   - Identify the main theories, methodologies, and approaches used in previous research.
   - Highlight the strengths, limitations, and gaps in the existing literature.

5. Research Framework and Methodological Approach:
   - Discuss the rationale for using a multi-source archaeological study, integrating environmental proxies such as animal and plant remains.
   - Explain the significance of using a Bayesian approach to multilevel modeling and the application of beta-binomial models for data analysis.
   - Justify the use of the selected datasets and the importance of a holistic approach.

6. Research Questions and Hypotheses:
   - Clearly state the research questions and hypotheses derived from the gaps identified in the literature.
   - Link each research question to the relevant themes or topics discussed earlier.

7. Summary and Research Gap:
   - Summarize the key findings and insights from the literature review.
   - Identify the specific research gap that your study aims to address.
   - Emphasize the unique contribution of your research in filling the identified gap.
