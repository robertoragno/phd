Grape
In the present study grape pips are counted as one if they were relatively complete, i.e., if an oval shaped chazal scar or `shield ́ on the dorsal side and two halves of the symmetrical pip with the two narrow furrows on the ventral side with a central `bridge ́ were roughly intact. A separate category for preserved grape pit half fragments was constructed, which were divided by two, and fragments of grape pips, which were divided by four, for both carbonised and mineralised specimens. All carbonised category count of grape pip (i.e pip, half of pip and fragment of pip) were then summed for the 'correction' count. Similarly, all mineralised counts of grape pip (i.e pip, half of pip and fragment of pip) were summed for the 'correction' count.
Another separate category was created for charred grape pips embedded in mesocarp, which were counted as one whole grape. Grape petioles or the stems attaching the fruit to the vine were given a separate category.
Olive
It was decided that to avoid an over-representation of carbonised olive fragments due to their high preservation and recovery rates, a correction factor was needed to avoid skewing the results. Thus, the weight of three whole charred archaeological olive stones from the Insula was recorded and divided by three to obtain an Average Weight (0.157grams). To produce an estimate of the percentage of whole olive stones by weight, the weight of charred olive stone fragments from other deposits was divided by the Average Weight for an olive stone. The number of fragments of olive were recorded in the category 'fragment of endocarp', along with the weight in grams. Whole or complete olive stones were counted as one and olive stones split along suture lines were counted as half. The 'correction' category for olive endocarp was then calculated as the sum of the fraction of olive endocarp fragments (grams)/Avg Weight (grams), along with the sum of any whole olive endocarps (counted as one) and any half olive endocarps (counted as a half).
Fig
In this study the volume of fig mesocarp and fig achenes was measured, if present in large quantities, to avoid an overrepresentation of this taxon due to the abundance of mineralised fig achenes. A known volume of only mineralised fig achenes was counted and used to estimate other large volumes of this taxon.
Fruit
Due to the paucity of archaeobotanical fruit remains all recovered endocarp (stone) fragments or seeds were counted as one.
Nutshell
All nutshell fragments were recorded as fragments and counted whether diagnostic features were present or not. The category of `nuts (generic) ́ was created as many carbonised fragments of nutshells lack diagnostic features.
Cereals
Whole grains of cereals were counted as one and cereal fragments were grouped together to obtain an estimate of the number of entire grains. All chaff components, including glumes, and rachis fragments, were counted as one specimen, while spikelet forks were counted as a half. All fragments of Triticum were counted as one due to the small numbers recovered. This included the category Triticum sp. which could not be identified down to species.
Millets
All recovered millets were counted as one in this study.
Pulses
Small pulse seeds, whether whole or incomplete were also counted as one. Whole Vicia specimens were counted as one and individual cotyledons were counted as half. In addition, fractions of specimens of Vicia were also counted, including `greater than two thirds ́ and `less than one third ́ to obtain a more accurate estimate.";"When compiling this row, I decided to round the absolute counts to the nearest integer.

Grape
In the present study grape pips are counted as one if they were relatively complete, i.e., if an oval shaped chazal scar or `shield ́ on the dorsal side and two halves of the symmetrical pip with the two narrow furrows on the ventral side with a central `bridge ́ were roughly intact. A separate category for preserved grape pit half fragments was constructed, which were divided by two, and fragments of grape pips, which were divided by four, for both carbonised and mineralised specimens. All carbonised category count of grape pip (i.e pip, half of pip and fragment of pip) were then summed for the 'correction' count. Similarly, all mineralised counts of grape pip (i.e pip, half of pip and fragment of pip) were summed for the 'correction' count.
Another separate category was created for charred grape pips embedded in mesocarp, which were counted as one whole grape. Grape petioles or the stems attaching the fruit to the vine were given a separate category.
Olive
It was decided that to avoid an over-representation of carbonised olive fragments due to their high preservation and recovery rates, a correction factor was needed to avoid skewing the results. Thus, the weight of three whole charred archaeological olive stones from the Insula was recorded and divided by three to obtain an Average Weight (0.157grams). To produce an estimate of the percentage of whole olive stones by weight, the weight of charred olive stone fragments from other deposits was divided by the Average Weight for an olive stone. The number of fragments of olive were recorded in the category 'fragment of endocarp', along with the weight in grams. Whole or complete olive stones were counted as one and olive stones split along suture lines were counted as half. The 'correction' category for olive endocarp was then calculated as the sum of the fraction of olive endocarp fragments (grams)/Avg Weight (grams), along with the sum of any whole olive endocarps (counted as one) and any half olive endocarps (counted as a half).
Fig
In this study the volume of fig mesocarp and fig achenes was measured, if present in large quantities, to avoid an overrepresentation of this taxon due to the abundance of mineralised fig achenes.

Grape
In the present study grape pips are counted as one if they were relatively complete, i.e., if an oval shaped chazal scar or `shield ́ on the dorsal side and two halves of the symmetrical pip with the two narrow furrows on the ventral side with a central `bridge ́ were roughly intact. A separate category for preserved grape pit half fragments was constructed, which were divided by two, and fragments of grape pips, which were divided by four, for both carbonised and mineralised specimens. All carbonised category count of grape pip (i.e pip, half of pip and fragment of pip) were then summed for the 'correction' count. Similarly, all mineralised counts of grape pip (i.e pip, half of pip and fragment of pip) were summed for the 'correction' count.
Another separate category was created for charred grape pips embedded in mesocarp, which were counted as one whole grape. Grape petioles or the stems attaching the fruit to the vine were given a separate category.
Olive
It was decided that to avoid an over-representation of carbonised olive fragments due to their high preservation and recovery rates, a correction factor was needed to avoid skewing the results. Thus, the weight of three whole charred archaeological olive stones from the Insula was recorded and divided by three to obtain an Average Weight (0.157grams). To produce an estimate of the percentage of whole olive stones by weight, the weight of charred olive stone fragments from other deposits was divided by the Average Weight for an olive stone. The number of fragments of olive were recorded in the category 'fragment of endocarp', along with the weight in grams. Whole or complete olive stones were counted as one and olive stones split along suture lines were counted as half. The 'correction' category for olive endocarp was then calculated as the sum of the fraction of olive endocarp fragments (grams)/Avg Weight (grams), along with the sum of any whole olive endocarps (counted as one) and any half olive endocarps (counted as a half).

In this study the volume of fig mesocarp and fig achenes was measured, if present in large quantities, to avoid an overrepresentation of this taxon due to the abundance of mineralised fig achenes. A known volume of only mineralised fig achenes was counted and used to estimate other large volumes of this taxon.
Fruit
Due to the paucity of archaeobotanical fruit remains all recovered endocarp (stone) fragments or seeds were counted as one.
Nutshell
All nutshell fragments were recorded as fragments and counted whether diagnostic features were present or not. The category of `nuts (generic) ́ was created as many carbonised fragments of nutshells lack diagnostic features.

Grape
In the present study grape pips are counted as one if they were relatively complete, i.e., if an oval shaped chazal scar or `shield ́ on the dorsal side and two halves of the symmetrical pip with the two narrow furrows on the ventral side with a central `bridge ́ were roughly intact. A separate category for preserved grape pit half fragments was constructed, which were divided by two, and fragments of grape pips, which were divided by four, for both carbonised and mineralised specimens. All carbonised category count of grape pip (i.e pip, half of pip and fragment of pip) were then summed for the 'correction' count. Similarly, all mineralised counts of grape pip (i.e pip, half of pip and fragment of pip) were summed for the 'correction' count.
Another separate category was created for charred grape pips embedded in mesocarp, which were counted as one whole grape. Grape petioles or the stems attaching the fruit to the vine were given a separate category.
Olive
It was decided that to avoid an over-representation of carbonised olive fragments due to their high preservation and recovery rates, a correction factor was needed to avoid skewing the results. Thus, the weight of three whole charred archaeological olive stones from the Insula was recorded and divided by three to obtain an Average Weight (0.157grams). To produce an estimate of the percentage of whole olive stones by weight, the weight of charred olive stone fragments from other deposits was divided by the Average Weight for an olive stone. The number of fragments of olive were recorded in the category 'fragment of endocarp', along with the weight in grams.

The deposit dates from the 2nd to the 1st c. BCE. Flotation with a Siraf machine was used. The seeds are both waterlogged and charred, and the publication lists them separately. For convenience, in this entry they have been merged together. From the Roman layer 10296 seeds have been found, from 73 samples examined (350 l / 510 kg). From the text: The uppermost layers of the deposit were sampled in a simple random pattern across the investigated area, collecting at least 15–20 equal size soil samples of about 5 liters each� For the other submerged archaeological layers, a bulk sampling strategy was adopted� A 10-liter sample was assumed as standard for the whole deposit, to avoid any diversity of sampling in the various con- texts and to limit the need to adapt the size of the soil samples as analysis proceeded� The weight of each soil sample was not uniform, as the moisture and the den- sity of the deposit varied from the top (mostly dry soil) to the bottom (mostly wet/moist soil), and by layer and area according to the presence of solid material.

A rich Roman domus was discovered during construction works below ground level in the historical centre of the town. Archaeological deposits from the Roman age, lying on top of alluvial layers, were found at a depth of around 7e3 m. Several coins and a great quantity of ceramic items made it possible to attribute the layers of the domus to different chronological phases (Benassi and Guandalini, 2011). The domus was built over layers dating to the early phases of Romanisation in the Republican age (3rde2nd century BC), renovated in the early Imperial age (1ste2nd century AD), and then abandoned around the 2nd-3rd century AD.";Bosi et al 2015;Roman;10.928232455077998;44.64481839890194;;1;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;51;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;2;;

A drainage channel and an aqueduct with a settling tank, dating to the 1st century AD, were covered by an alluvial layer at 3.1 m. The layer was then colonised by a woodland, as shown by the presence of large trunks that had fallen, found near stumps. Oaks and elms were identified, and the trunks more than 122 years old were subjected to dendrochrono- logical analyses (see above). Two radiocarbon datings performed on one trunk gave a dating of 319e539 AD (87.1%) and 327e543 AD (92.9%).

Plant macrofossil (carpological) and morpho- metric analyses were carried out on plant remains from the medieval castle of Miranduolo, Siena, a rural settlement in central Italy with a long sequence of occupation between the 8th and the 11th centuries A.D. The presence of Triticum aestivum/durum and Vicia faba var. minor from the first phase of the Lombard farming village suggests continuity with the agricultural tradition of the preceding Roman world, and the use of good cultivation techniques that allowed quality yields to be obtained from rather poor soils. At the same time, the significant presence of the primitive cereal T. monococcum, compared with the ar- chaeobotanical literature of north-central Italy, allows to us consider it as a ‘‘cultural’’ element of Lombard farming. In the next cultural phases, with the Carolingian manor and then with the feudal castle, the stable presence of T. aes- tivum/durum and the reduction of T. monococcum in favour of more productive cereals such as Secale cereale and Hordeum vulgare indicate a further improvement in pro- ductivity. This is also confirmed by the appearance of fruits and nuts such as Castanea sativa, Vitis vinifera and Prunus persica. The increase in caryopsis sizes of T. monococcum and T. aestivum/durum in the transition from the village to the manorial phase is a consequence of the improvementsin farming. The decrease in caryopsis size of T. mono- coccum from the manor phase to that of the castle testifies the decreasing importance of this cereal.

A drainage channel and an aqueduct with a settling tank, dating to the 1st century AD, were covered by an alluvial layer at 3.1 m. The layer was then colonised by a woodland, as shown by the presence of large trunks that had fallen, found near stumps. Oaks and elms were identified, and the trunks more than 122 years old were subjected to dendrochrono- logical analyses (see above). Two radiocarbon datings performed on one trunk gave a dating of 319e539 AD (87.1%) and 327e543 AD (92.9%).

From Buonincontri et al 2014: The presence of valuable crops such as T. aestivum/durum and V. faba suggests continuity with the agricultural tradition of the Roman world. Already from the 8th century A.D. the inhabitants were able to produce good quality yields on unfavourable soils, thanks to careful cultivation techniques.
The constant presence of hardier cereals such as T. monococcum, Hordeum, Secale and P. miliaceum shows the will to grow a wide range of crops in order to manage any bad harvests, and it indicates the inhabitants’ aware- ness of the low agricultural potential of the land. T. monococcum can be considered a ‘‘cultural’’ element of Lombard crops.";Buonincontri et al 2014;Lombard;11.079989431456067;43.120523086437785;200;12;115;47;12;28;2;;;60;2;;;7;;1;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

From Buonincontri et al 2014: In the Carolingian period, the reduction of T. mono- coccum in favour of more productive crops such as Secale and Hordeum indicates a further improvement of produc- tive capacity as also confirmed by the appearance of luxury fruit trees. The final phase of the Carolingian empire and of the period under a feudal economic system is characterized by greater attention to an economy devoted to achieving a production surplus.; Morphometric analysis validated the supposed improvements of the productive processes from the village to the manorial phase and the following significant loss of importance of T. monococcum.
